Centralized control over the ability to buy and sell was impossible, as was centralized surveillance of individual transactions.</p> <p>This freedom was a good thing, and now, as a result of rapidly evolving technology, it's disappearing.</p> <p>The Canadian government has invoked emergency powers to freeze protesters' bank accounts without due process. PayPal has declared its intention to monitor users' speech and fine them for expressing views the company considers objectionable. </p> <p>Across the industrialized world, central banks are planning to replace national currencies with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These will enable states to track and, if they wish, block or reverse any monetary transaction, no matter how trivial.</p> <p>We can't accept this outcome. The freedom to transact needs to be seen as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. To do otherwise risks forfeiting protections we once took for granted against potentially horrific abuse: the ability to earn money and spend it on daily necessities without seeking the approval of powerful, unaccountable institutions.</p> <h2>Definitions</h2> <p>This essay will make frequent use of a few terms that might not be familiar. They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.</p> <h3>Censorship resistance</h3> <p><em>Censorship resistance </em>refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.</p> <p>No messaging app, however, is fully censorship-<em>proof</em>. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: <em>censorship-resistant</em>.</p> <p>The concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.</p> <p>Censorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as <em>non-confiscatable</em>. </p> <p>An example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.</p> <p>I should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.</p> <p>Bitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like<br /> <br /> <code>bc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj</code><br /> <br /> – and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.) </p> <h3>Permissionlessness</h3> <p><em>Permissionlessness</em> refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're <em>permissioned</em>): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.</p> <p>Bitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.</p> <h3>Decentralization</h3> <p><em>Decentralization </em>refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are <em>centralized</em>. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.</p> <p>Bitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.</p> <p>Decentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.</p> <h2>Initial thoughts</h2> <p><em>Imagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.</em></p> <p>Suzuha</p> <p><br /></p> <p>A right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them <em>rights</em> in the first place.</p> <p>We say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.</p> <p>By the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.</p> <p>Certainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.</p> <p>And granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.</p> <p>So why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.</p> <p>If people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.</p> <p>The other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.</p> <p>Such permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.</p> <p>But shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.<sup><a href='#fn1' id='fnref1' epub:type='noteref'>1</a></sup> But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.</p> <p>Take speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.</p> <p>In recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.</p> <p>On the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.</p> <p>After the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.<sup><a href='#fn2' id='fnref2' epub:type='noteref'>2</a></sup> From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.</p> <p>Today powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.<sup><a href='#fn3' id='fnref3' epub:type='noteref'>3</a></sup> Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.</p> <p>Ordinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'<sup><a href='#fn4' id='fnref4' epub:type='noteref'>4</a></sup>) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.</p> <p>Complex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.</p> <p>Phil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'<sup><a href='#fn5' id='fnref5' epub:type='noteref'>5</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Today, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.</p> <p>Today we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.</p> <p>Technological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.</p> <p>A state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.</p> <p>We need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.</p> <p>Within recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.<sup><a href='#fn6' id='fnref6' epub:type='noteref'>6</a></sup>)</p> <p>Credit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.</p> <p>No one used payment apps. No one used any apps.</p> <p>The beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.</p> <p>By and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.</p> <p>Several factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.</p> <p>But I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.</p> <p>Today, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.</p> <p>In any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.</p> <p>Given past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,<sup><a href='#fn7' id='fnref7' epub:type='noteref'>7</a></sup> but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.</p> <p>The topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.</p> <p>To the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.</p> <p>The generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.</p> <p>Orwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.</p> <p>To revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological contagion. According to the Annals of Lorsch, the emperor requested a copy of a history of the papacy from Pope Adrian I in 774. The book, which to be clear, had already been written, took a year to be hand-copied and transported over the Alps.</p> <p>That was the velocity at which the two most powerful men in western Europe, the heirs of Peter the apostle and Caesar Augustus, could transmit information. Both would have been flummoxed by our anxiety over the instantaneous, global spread of heresy – sorry, <em>misinformation</em> – via light pulsing through massive cables at the bottom of the sea. </p> <p>Twelve centuries later, people's grasp of current and emerging technological capabilities is so unevenly distributed that we walk the earth simultaneously with Charlemagnes, Morses, Daguerres, Bells, Diffies and Berners-Lees.<sup><a href='#fn8' id='fnref8' epub:type='noteref'>8</a></sup> Some of us, including the most powerful among us, don't consider how control of digital payment rails could pose a threat to anyone; others are launching us into a future so new and strange that vanishingly few people understand the risks and opportunities. Likely they themselves don't understand.</p> <p>We won't have centuries to figure out the implications of credit cards – to say nothing of fully programmable money under centralized bureaucratic control in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p> <p>CBDCs are one of the main concerns of this essay, and I'll go into borderline-excessive detail about them later on, but briefly: they are digital currency issued directly by central banks. Take Europe as an example. The European Central Bank issues the euro, and for the most part, euros are already digital; physical coins and bills make up a fraction of the total value of the currency. But the 'digital euro,' or whatever it ends up being called, will mark a sharp departure from how the euro works today.</p> <p>As a CBDC, it will incorporate a complete record of every transaction in which it's used. This record will be available to bureaucrats and, by extension, politicians and law enforcement. Today, your bank knows when you spend euros deposited with them, or receive them to your account. But the central bank and the rest of the EU government don't know. They likely have some idea – perhaps more than you think – but their picture is necessarily incomplete.</p> <p>With a CBDC, the state will receive a complete, real-time stream of all transaction data. Following the elimination of cash – a goal closely associated with the introduction of CBDCs – there will be no legal way to transact outside of this government panopticon.</p> <p>The state will also be able to control CBDC transactions: freeze your account, confiscate your funds, prevent you from sending money to or receiving it from certain parties – whoever the state deems unfit. The rules governing how money works could in principle be arbitrarily complex and liable to change at any time.</p> <p>Banks can act this way today, and sometimes they do – often enough, when they do, it's at the behest of the state. But with a CBDC, the government will be able to intervene directly – no need to go through private-sector intermediaries who might make a fuss. Arbitrary limitations on the freedom to transact and summary seizures of funds might of course be illegal, but the question could quickly become academic. When violating the law at scale becomes so easy, the government might be hard to convince to do otherwise, especially when it can instantly revoke its critics' ability to buy food.</p> <p>For the moment, CBDCs are more idea than reality. But world leaders are openly discussing their development and introduction. China is already testing a prototype at scale. The Bahamas has deployed one nationwide, the only country to do so – although almost no one uses it. In Europe and the U.S., bureaucratic and legislative wheels are turning. Journalists are being primed.</p> <p>The same Turing completeness that lets you build a website that can look like anything and do anything with any data you give it, will determine the degree to which currency can be configured, manipulated and controlled. Drain the account of a single dissident; confiscate $200 from every resident of Los Angeles; give $50 to anyone who voted a certain way – hell, anyone born in July. The possibilities are endless.</p> <p>Of course nothing is (entirely) new under the sun. Authorities have been seizing and doling out assets for millennia: the story of the Knights Templar comes to mind as a dramatic and well-known pre-modern example of punitive confiscation. But if Philip IV of France could seize the bodies and assets of 100-something individuals, he could never have dreamed of issuing an order that would render all the coinage in an entire district worthless instantly.</p> <p>That's the sort of fearsome miracle central banks might be able to carry out in a few years: update a database row, tweak a configuration, perhaps for the really tough cases, write a few lines of code, <em>et voilà</em>.</p> <p>As Matt Odell, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, has written, the preferred interface for this kind of thing is likely to be an AI chat bot, which 'seems ideal for weaponizing massive surveillance databases way more efficiently than current search tools.' (He provides an example input: 'close the bank accounts of anyone who went to the anti government protest in Paris last week.')<sup><a href='#fn9' id='fnref9' epub:type='noteref'>9</a></sup></p> <p>By combining streams of near-perfect surveillance, the state will be able to view an individual's physical movements, reading material, expressions of opinion, social interactions and monetary transactions as a unified whole. They will have the ability to instantaneously throttle or halt the economic activity of individual dissidents and entire social groups.</p> <p>In the U.S., this outcome still lies somewhere over the horizon – how far is anyone's guess – and may even be avoided to some appreciable degree. In China, this reality has already begun to take shape.</p> <p>Beginning in April 2022, banks in the central Chinese province of Henan suspended cash withdrawals, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without access to their savings. The following month, hundreds of protesters traveled to Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, to demand the return of their money. When they planned to repeat the protest that June, however, many found themselves unable to leave their homes. The government had falsely diagnosed them with covid, flipping the health codes on the would-be protesters' phones to red. Under the draconian lockdown regime in place in China at that time, this was the equivalent of placing them under house arrest.<sup><a href='#fn10' id='fnref10' epub:type='noteref'>10</a></sup></p> <p>The mechanism for social control in this case wasn't a CBDC – though China has been actively testing one in a growing number of provinces since 2020 – but it's easy enough to see the template behind these actions: centralized institutions (according to protesters, the banks are connected to political power brokers) seize people's assets, then prevent their victims from causing trouble by restricting their movements.</p> <p>Both steps could be accomplished more efficiently using a CBDC: you can go protest in Zhengzhou, no problem, as long as you don't need to pay for transportation or fuel or food.</p> <p>Fortunately, even as new technologies are enabling sinister authoritarianism, they are providing a means of escape. A parallel financial system built on cryptocurrency protocols has begun to take shape. This system has defied censorship or control by even the most determined and powerful global actors, and it's only becoming stronger and more resilient. (Its relationship to surveillance is complex, simplifying it at times, frustrating at others, but it effectively thwarts attempts at censorship.)</p> <p>Proponents of the emerging crypto financial system often stress the minimization of trust: you don't control your crypto assets when a custodian has promised to hold them for you, or the courts have vowed to protect them, or the architects of the system have assured you its source code is safe and benign. You control your crypto assets when, and only when, you're the only one in control of the cryptographic keys, and the software encoding the system is open for you and all the world to scrutinize, tinker with and attack.</p> <p>This is all perfectly true. And it goes some way towards accomplishing a laudable goal: obviating the whole discussion of 'rights,' at least as far as money is concerned. Bankers, payment processors, politicians and bureaucrats will respect the sanctity of your rights, right up until the moment they don't. Ethereum, bitcoin and their ilk are machines. You can see the code they run on, and those are the rules. They are indifferent to moral panics, social engineering, dot plots and managerial maneuvering.</p> <p>This description does not, of course, apply equally well to all cryptocurrencies, some of which are very much centralized. At the time of writing, though, protocols such as bitcoin and ethereum are credibly decentralized, neutral and censorship-resistant. Nor am I aware of a technology outside of cryptocurrency that accomplishes anything comparable.</p> <p>If the technology exists to escape the slide into financial tyranny, then why write a polemic about the <em>right to transact?</em> Will invoking a slogan protect our freedoms better than building decentralized, censorship-resistant systems? Wouldn't my time be better spent implementing the latest research into, say, zero-knowledge proofs – or the nearest thing my skill set allows?</p> <p>Don't cypherpunks write code?<sup><a href='#fn11' id='fnref11' epub:type='noteref'>11</a></sup></p> <p>My answer is that our technological arsenal is critical, but not enough on its own. We need social consensus on what the technology means and what ends it serves. Do elliptic curves care about our ideologies? Of course not. The shapes rotate on, elegant, indifferent, unstoppable. <em>E pur si muove.</em> But without an ideological, moral, political – in short, a memetic – component, we can't make the case for adopting these technologies at scale. We can't develop arguments to prevent them from being defanged, backdoored, persecuted, or regulated into docility. </p> <p>We need an intellectual arsenal to fight the already-very-much-underway backlash by that sadly large cohort in every place and time that wants to be coerced.</p> <p>Nor can even the most sublimely implemented blockchain hold the violence of the state at bay, at least not directly: they may never be able to block or reverse a single transaction, but they can send men with guns to your house and put you in a cage. They may even take your private keys in the process. A pervasive cultural sense that people have a right to transact helps reduce that risk. A law or constitutional amendment would be even better – while clearly recognizing that all of it would be meaningless absent the power of the protocols themselves.</p> <p>But in all seriousness, if you're reading this and think your time is better spent building freedom-preserving cryptography – I agree. Put this down and get back to it. Please hurry.</p> <p>Only a handful of people are likely to be raising that objection, though, and in any case, they're already sold on the arguments I care about. We share a fundamental commitment to the freedom to transact, they're just purists. (Or as they might put it, I'm a tourist.)</p> <p>Other, much larger groups of people will have different and more fundamental hesitations about the wisdom or usefulness of this 'right to transact.' In the rest of this essay, I'll attempt to address those as best I can. For now, here's the short version.</p> <p>First: the freedom to transact we enjoyed until very recently was a good thing. It deserves to be regarded as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. Doing so involves significant risks and tradeoffs, but the downsides are much exaggerated. Due process has downsides. Protections against unreasonable search and seizure have downsides. We accept them for good reason, and those who would erode these rights are usually concerned not so much with safety, fairness, justice and the rest, as they are with imposing control over a cowed populace. This is the case with the right to transact.</p> <p>Second: this right, so long enjoyed in practice without being discussed, because it seemed natural and was hardly ever threatened, is now rapidly disappearing. This is a harmful process that should be stopped and reversed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Or if not, if abolishing the freedom to transact is somehow a good thing, the people who think so need to make their case. Taking away a freedom that has so thoroughly pervaded our lives should involve the democratic process. It shouldn't occur in silence as the result of a thousand small decisions by private firms and bureaucrats. Pass a law. (Or better yet, come and take it.)</p> <p>Third: we currently possess technologies that, properly deployed, maintained and adopted, will substantially restore and protect the right to transact. We should reject attempts, however well-intentioned, to muddy the waters about what cryptocurrency represents at this moment in history. Its drawbacks and growing pains, while real, are more than acceptable in the face of the alternative, which is to embrace our slide into perfect surveillance and financial unfreedom. There is no third option that pleases crypto's critics while preserving even a modicum of the freedom previous generations enjoyed.</p> <p>Starting with number one then:</p> <h2>The freedom to transact is a good thing</h2> <p><em>For if Power without laws, can make laws and change the Fundamentall laws of the Kingdome, I know not what subject in England can be secure of his life, or of any thing which he doth call his own.</em></p> <p>Charles I</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Trying to justify a basic moral truth in abstract terms is usually a bad idea. If personal experience, knowledge of history and a general moral framework can't convince you one way or the other on questions like the freedom of worship or the right to due process, a soup of latinate nouns isn't likely to do the trick.</p> <p>Appeals to empathy may have a better chance of success, but empathy won't spontaneously arise in someone who's lacked it so far. And those who enjoy the good graces of the powers that be – through whatever combination of luck, enthusiasm, docility and compromise – often struggle to imagine themselves at the wrong end of arbitrary power.</p> <p>It's tempting, and perhaps wise, to simply reject the whole exercise. If people truly have a right to transact, say so and leave it at that. Agents and fans of state and corporate power will deny any such right exists, however sublime the arguments in its favor. And people who value individual liberty are likely to agree with the basic position, even if the arguments are nonsense.</p> <p>The authors of the Declaration of Independence didn't tie themselves in philosophical knots over the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They called the whole package 'self-evident' – along with human equality, for good measure – and they moved on.</p> <p>Sadly, I doubt I can get away with the kind of terse moral clarity the American founders used. The fact is that not everyone holds this truth – that all people should be free to transact – to be self-evident. Most people, through no fault of their own, don't know what it would even refer to. <em>What do you mean, who's stopping you?</em></p> <p>As I've argued, the issue hasn't been salient until now, given the capabilities at would-be oppressors' disposal. Cash, the quintessential means of free transaction, remains a fact of daily life. We don't learn in school about some bygone decade's fight to transact freely, because the clash is only beginning – assuming we put up any fight to speak of. The battle lines are mostly alien to the public forum, combining with more familiar fronts in the culture war to form an uncompelling scalene triangle. Accepting or hastening the end of the freedom to transact is, for the moment, the bipartisan default.<sup><a href='#fn12' id='fnref12' epub:type='noteref'>12</a></sup></p> <p>It's also worth noting that the Declaration of Independence didn't instantly end the struggle for basic liberties through the power of stirring language alone. Seven more years of war were necessary to decide this 'self-evident' question.</p> <h3>The right to transact as prerequisite</h3> <p>For the most straightforward and perhaps the most convincing argument I've heard regarding the right to transact, I'm indebted to 6529. I prefer to phrase it in my own words, so please don't attribute any shortcomings in my formulation to him (?), but he deserves the credit for showing me how simple the question really is: once we're denied the right to transact, we're denied every other right by extension.<sup><a href='#fn13' id='fnref13' epub:type='noteref'>13</a></sup></p> <p>The ability to buy and sell things is a prerequisite to rights we already regard as inalienable. Take the right to life: it becomes all but impossible to live when you can't buy food, pay for shelter, or sell goods and labor to obtain money in the first place.</p> <p>A person who isn't allowed to buy or rent a car, or pay for a bus or train ticket, can hardly be said to enjoy liberty. Someone barred from basic participation in the economy can't pursue happiness.</p> <p>Remove the right to transact, and you've in practice trampled on any other civil, human and constitutional right we might care to mention.</p> <p>To be completely clear, I'm not describing a situation of poverty, though that would likely be the ultimate result of the situation I <em>am</em> describing: one in which a person has money, or easily could, but they've been cut off from the system that makes it usable. Their deposits are frozen; their means of sending a payment is disabled; their means of receiving a payment is disabled. </p> <p>I have in mind a situation in which money cannot meaningfully be owned except by its state or private-sector administrators, who grant access to it contingent on whatever criteria they choose.</p> <p>But what would such a world – such a money – look like? That's hard to say definitively, since it's never existed.</p> <h3>A thought experiment</h3> <p>It isn't difficult to imagine, though. Here's a situation that, given the trajectory of technological and political developments, an ordinary person could plausibly experience before the decade is out: without having been charged with any crime, much less convicted of one, she wakes up to find that her digital wallet no longer works.</p> <p>Let's call her Alice.</p> <p>Alice walks into a cafe in the morning, orders a coffee, and taps her phone to pay for it. A peevish vibration alerts her that the transaction has failed. The Federal Reserve wallet app (let's say she's American), containing all of her dollar deposits in the form of a central bank digital currency, has rejected the purchase. She doesn't carry physical cash, because the government no longer issues it or recognizes it as legal tender.</p> <p>She tries again, and the phone buzzes again. An error message on her screen informs her, unhelpfully, that something has gone wrong. She drives to a gas station and the error repeats. She can no longer travel. The grocery store won't take her payment either. A week later, the lights and heat go out. She can't pay her utility bills, or for that matter her rent.</p> <p>If Alice works outside the home, and she can't get to her workplace reliably or at all, she'll lose her job and income. If she works from home, her ability to do so will depend on her having, at a minimum, basic shelter and utilities, and realistically much more than that: the equipment and services she needs to perform her work, even if that's just a laptop with an internet connection.</p> <p>Of course, the question of having what she needs to work might be irrelevant. Let's assume the account freeze hasn't simply prevented Alice from sending money – it's blocked her from receiving it. Even if she could work, she couldn't be paid.</p> <p>A credit card might help fend off the crisis for a few weeks or months, but if her digital dollar wallet remains locked, those bills will go unpaid, and that means of transacting will disappear as well. Nor does it seem likely that the card company would extend credit to someone whose central bank wallet had been shut off.</p> <p>Alice may have no method of finding out why she can't send or receive money. Huge, unaccountable institutions often decline to explain their motives. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that some explanation is provided.</p> <p>What could a satisfactory explanation be? What could justify this treatment?</p> <p>What could Alice have done – or failed to do – such that a constitutional democracy, subject to the rule of law, could countenance this response? Perhaps an especially vicious crime would, set in the scales of justice, balance out this fate more or less. But if Alice were a dangerous criminal, a menace to those around her, the solution wouldn't be to leave her out on the street, free to commit further acts of depraved violence. It would be to incarcerate her.</p> <p>Simply removing Alice's ability to obtain the necessities of life doesn't protect her neighbors. If anything it endangers them more: now she's not just a violent criminal, but a violent criminal deprived of all legal means of getting food and shelter. Nor does the punishment serve to reform or rehabilitate her. There are those who see prison as a barbaric institution to be abolished entirely; somehow I doubt they'd see removal from the economy as a viable alternative.</p> <p>If Alice were a fraudster, a Madoff who'd committed financial crimes, this punishment might have a certain karmic ring to it. But it would be unconstitutional: the Eighth Amendment bars the justice system from imposing ironic sentences like folktale genies.</p> <p>It's difficult to imagine treating someone this way for any reason, which seems to me a serviceable, if inside-out, definition of a right. We would not, for any reason, forbid someone to espouse a particular faith; in other words, we recognize the freedom of worship. We would not strip someone of the ability to use their nation's currency; in other words, we recognize the freedom to transact.</p> <p>It goes without saying that the right to transact doesn't make any given good or service automatically legal to buy or sell. Illegal items and activities would remain illegal. You are not, nor should you be, allowed to possess a collection of potent nerve agents. But we might add, without any contradiction, that it would be absurd to revoke your permission to use money, based on the assumption – however well-founded – that you would use it to buy potent nerve agents.</p> <h3>Terms of service</h3> <p>Such an approach would of course be expedient for law enforcement and financial institutions, but their convenience shouldn't define what a liberal society does and doesn't allow. We can't accept preemptive asset freezing any more than we would accept a person having their right to free speech preemptively revoked, based on the idea – again, however well-founded – that their ravings might give rise to something illegal.</p> <p>And yet making the lives of cops and compliance officers easy is exactly what lies at the root, not just of Alice's hypothetical hell, but of a growing number of real people's (more on that later).</p> <p>There are clear precedents for treating people in similar ways. Social media companies routinely remove content and ban users who engage in perfectly legal, but ugly or inconvenient, speech. Unacceptable as the platforms' behavior may be according to any good-faith interpretation of democratic, constitutional principles, such expedients became the norm in less than a decade.<sup><a href='#fn14' id='fnref14' epub:type='noteref'>14</a></sup> It is convenient for powerful people and wholly satisfactory to powerful political coalitions. Unsurprisingly, no one has stopped it.</p> <p>Returning to the question of what Alice might have done to deserve her fate, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that she somehow violated the Fed's terms of service. We posited that she wasn't charged with a crime. If she had been – or rather, if she'd been convicted – she might justly suffer unpleasant consequences, though summary removal from the economy would be a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.</p> <p>The idea that a court would let a convicted criminal remain physically free, but strip them of the ability legally to obtain basic necessities, is – thankfully – unrealistic. What's depressingly plausible is this scenario: aided by constant surveillance, a bureaucrat or, more likely, an automated system, registers some Suspicious Activity. It expels the person responsible without providing any form of recourse or due process: <em>Your account has been flagged for unusual activity. Please contact our support team to resolve this issue. </em>The support team is an AI chat bot that might as well be a stone wall, and there's no way to speak to a human being.</p> <p>Welcome to the black market.</p> <p>The offenses for which a person might be removed from the payments infrastructure are unlikely to have been clearly enumerated by a democratically elected legislature. More likely they'll be written by employees of a federal agency, or the Federal Reserve, or a private-sector firm to which CBDC development has been contracted out. These rules almost certainly won't be limited in scope or subject to more than symbolic oversight. Rather, they're likely to include the sort of <em>any other unacceptable conduct, as solely determined by us</em> language familiar to the dozen or so people who have actually read a terms of service agreement all the way through.</p> <h3>Ends and means</h3> <p>In some ways the preceding hypothetical is a bit extreme: most likely, relatively few individuals would be totally removed from a CBDC economy. Remove too many people entirely, and the black market will outstrip the approved one.</p> <p>Rather than focus too much on the unfortunate few who would be entirely excommunicated, let's consider the far greater numbers who would be subject to subtler infringements of their freedom.</p> <p>Having lacked the option to instantaneously fine-tune entire populations' access to money, it's hard to say exactly what policymakers would choose to do with this ability. There are no straightforward precedents. Still, it's worth speculating. Sooner or later we'll arrive at a juncture where politicians and bureaucrats do enjoy these capabilities, in some countries if not most, so we should devote some thought to what they might do with them.</p> <p>Presumably, at least in the beginning, they would pursue benign-sounding goals. We can imagine a few possibilities: encouraging healthy, sustainable eating; discouraging drug and alcohol abuse; boosting favored industries; giving historically marginalized groups a leg up; and keeping inflation and unemployment in check.</p> <p>You may find that your spending on fresh produce is subsidized with little discounts to encourage a healthy diet. Same, perhaps, for plant-based meat substitutes. You might find, by contrast, that the five pounds of steak you wanted to buy for a birthday barbecue trigger a penalty, or even rejection: three pounds of red meat is the most you can purchase in a week. Perhaps your third trip to the bar or casino this week similarly fails. Or maybe your phone's accelerometer, GPS and other sensors come to the conclusion that you've been indulging in cocaine again, and it's time to throttle your spending for 36 hours so you can rethink your choices.</p> <p>Perhaps, in line with the Fed's attempts to lower unemployment and raise consistently below-target inflation (those were the days), a negative interest rate has been put in place, with the result that your deposits automatically fall by 0.5% per year.</p> <p>Perhaps, in order to reduce wealth inequality or discourage premature retirement, each dollar saved comes with a 20-year expiration date. </p> <p>Or perhaps a recent 'police-involved shooting' has led to protests in your part of town. Wallets in the area might be frozen until the crowds disperse – or even, to teach the querulous districts a lesson, a bit longer.</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that no one will be entirely free to spend their money on legal goods and services as they please. All money will to some degree resemble food stamps: not a uniform, neutral and universal means of exchange, but a form of coupon subject to complex, changing and humiliating rules. Your purchasing power will be a function of the government's opinion of your decision-making abilities.</p> <p>Unlike food stamps, though, the restrictions need not apply to all recipients in the same way. Favored people will obtain favored objects more easily. Disfavored people will need to justify their choices, and disfavored objects of desire will become harder to obtain. Nothing in principle would stop such restrictions from taking the minutest individual circumstances into account: limits to your freedom to transact could be targeted with the precision of social media ads.</p> <p>This is of course far too much power for anyone to have over the medium of exchange. The state cannot be allowed to intrude into every economic event, however minute, and not just as a spectator, but as the final arbiter of that transaction's acceptability.</p> <p>Before moving on, I should stress that the above – even if it sounds awful – is a relatively optimistic scenario. It's a vision of the sort of bumbling, manageably corrupt, blinkered, corporatized, residually competent state typical of Western democracies circa 2023.</p> <p>But there's no guarantee this situation persists even in the medium term. When a government veers sharply towards totalitarianism of whatever sort – communist, fascist, theocratic or in thrall to some fresh horror – it will enjoy the same fearsome control over payment systems as its on-the-whole democratic predecessor.</p> <p>The ability to interfere with people's freedom to transact, once obtained, will outlast any particular government or form of government. Even if liberal democracy writ large enjoys centuries of continued vigor, a few countries will fall into totalitarianism along the way. Anyone living in a constitutional democracy should hesitate to build a CBDC or any similar system – certainly for their own sakes, but also for their children's.</p> <p>And in any case, such a level of centralized control in itself can't help but alter the basic character of the state. The capabilities of centralized programmable currencies will change constitutional democracy in significant and unpredictable ways, assuming they don't simply destroy it.</p> <h3>Worse-case scenarios </h3> <p>Let's imagine this system in the hands of a more straightforwardly ruthless regime. First, we should acknowledge that the system can be combined with hyper-accurate personal data of any sort: location data, browsing history, social media interactions, calls, texts, medical records, 'smart home' audio recordings, footage from security cameras (equipped with facial recognition), genetic data. All of this data can then be synthesized, organized and interpreted with the aid of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Any government will eventually attempt to bring these methods of surveillance and analysis together into a more or less coherent apparatus. (Success is of course not guaranteed.) But the more straightforwardly power-hungry the state, the more quickly it will do so, and the less compunction it will have about, say, barring you from renting in a certain neighborhood due to the contents of your genome.</p> <p>Dictators have long seized and doled out assets to win support or punish dissent. Equipped with full visibility into and control over transactions, they'll be able to do so with ease and precision. Disfavored groups – be they long-oppressed or former oppressors – could find themselves, if not simply robbed, then fleeced by inflated prices, or barred from obtaining scarce or desirable goods. The malicious logic of the Jim Crow-era shop owner who quotes one price for a white customer and another, higher one for a black customer could be built into the means of exchange itself.</p> <p>Those marginalized by the state could be hemmed into ghettos by geographically delineated permissions to shop, rent, work, or get transportation. Even merchants and landlords who opposed such controls couldn't easily protest them: the transactions would simply fail. Nor does the control of movement need to be purely spatial: leaders will be able to impose targeted lockdowns and curfews using the same means (recall the protesting depositors' surprise covid diagnoses in Henan).</p> <p>And these restrictions could be arbitrarily fine-tuned. Using location data, the screws could be tightened on anyone who's frequented a particular house of worship – or failed to. The criteria for punishment could be anything: having purchased a certain book, downloaded a certain file, visited a certain clinic, immigrated from a certain country, attempted to emigrate to another one, purchased from a certain business – or better yet, failed to. Or it could be a matter of having spoken a bit too freely in the presence of a smartphone microphone.</p> <p>I'm hardly the first one to raise these concerns. Maya Zehavi, an Israeli founder and investor in the cryptocurrency industry, has written: 'The number one reason I'm against CBDC in the surveillance mode BIS is promoting - how my extended family managed to hide away money &amp; gold to survive the ww2 in relative safety. The rising fascism across the world alongside brewing antisemitism means we need to support a web […] For the worst case scenario.'<sup><a href='#fn15' id='fnref15' epub:type='noteref'>15</a></sup> </p> <p>In order to avoid becoming a tool of repression, money needs to remain neutral and portable. Enforcing the law is all well and good. But what if it's against the law to be Jewish, Tutsi, Rohingya, Uyghur? Have modern states demonstrated the wisdom and humanity we'd expect of institutions aspiring to build CBDCs? </p> <p>It's also important to stress that official neglect can be as harmful as official malice. Barring unprecedented feats of conscientiousness and efficiency on the part of the state, there will be many whose remoteness, poverty, lack of education, or mental or physical impairment will prevent them from gaining access to a CBDC in the first place. The state will have no particular quarrel with them – only a measure of contempt, when and if it remembers them. The result will be the same.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, central bankers almost always cite 'financial inclusion' (access to a bank account and a means of payment) as a reason to adopt CBDCs.<sup><a href='#fn16' id='fnref16' epub:type='noteref'>16</a></sup> It's true enough in principle that central banks could offer CBDC access to people who can't open accounts at private-sector banks.</p> <p>But in what world is making the use of currency – in any form – contingent on clearing bureaucratic hurdles like identity verification an <em>improvement</em> on the status quo? As I'll discuss later on, central banks also tout the ability to surveil CBDC usage and root out money laundering and illicit activity as an advantage. To do so, by their own admission, they'd need to tie CBDC accounts to verified, government-issued IDs – exactly what many of today's financially excluded lack.</p> <h3>Monopoly money</h3> <p>Nor will those excluded from the CBDC system, intentionally or not, be able to fall back on legacy forms of payment like cash – at least not legally. For the scheme to even plausibly accomplish policy goals, governments will need to ban physical cash.<sup><a href='#fn17' id='fnref17' epub:type='noteref'>17</a></sup></p> <p>Subsidies, taxes, interest rates, stimulus payments, fines, geographic restrictions, curfews, caps on holdings, expiration dates, surveillance – if alternatives to central bank digital money are allowed to persist, all of these tools lose at least some of their efficacy. Witness European central bankers' anxiety about (metaphorical, mostly) mattresses stuffed with cash, which made passing negative interest rates through to ordinary savers more or less impossible. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Andy Haldane floated a CBDC as a solution to this dilemma in a speech in 2015.<sup><a href='#fn18' id='fnref18' epub:type='noteref'>18</a></sup> </p> <p>Of course, black market means of exchange will emerge. Loopholes and workarounds will be found within the system. Their exact forms will depend on the system's idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities, but they'll certainly make use of combinations of flawed software, gaps in surveillance, and human laziness and corruption.</p> <p>There will also be parallel systems: physical or digital tokens more or less emulating cash will almost certainly circulate, but using them will invite punishment. For an idea of how little sense of humor the state is likely to have regarding alternate payment systems, see its reaction to tax evasion.</p> <h3>Tax evasion, money laundering and crime</h3> <p>Speaking of which, I should address a whole range of criticisms of my position. Collected under one heading, we might say: censorship-resistant, permissionless – in a word 'free' – transactions are, in fact, bad.</p> <p>People who argue the above might cite any combination of the following ills, all of which the freedom to transact does or at least could in principle facilitate: tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, smuggling, bribery, gambling, prostitution, trade in weapons, predatory lending, extortion, and terrorist financing. Apologies if I've forgotten anything: human creativity, in financial wrongdoing as in all things, is boundless.</p> <p>Small-scale tax evasion would certainly become more difficult under a CBDC regime. Cash transactions make underreporting not just easy but, I've heard, tempting. Governments have long managed to collect taxes without the aid of a financial panopticon, though given the tenacity of tax evasion, a certain amount of frustration is understandable.</p> <p>Modern states, more often than not, run grisly deficits, since they fail to tax at a rate anywhere near commensurate with their expenditures. (To do so would, at least in America, probably be impossible.) The incentive to build a system of total financial surveillance and control is clear, but I would argue that we simply can't consider tax evasion sufficient justification for the sort of regime that's being contemplated.</p> <p>After all, the ability to transact freely is nothing new: it's been the default for almost the entire time modern tax regimes have existed. Revenue collection has been imperfect as a result, but even so states have managed – at times – to keep debt within sustainable limits. When fiscal crises have occurred, the culprit has been war, unnecessary infrastructure projects, corruption, outright theft by the regime, or gambling by bankers far more often than it's been an especially tax-averse populace. Even where the tax take is abysmally low, the blame often lies with leaders who purchase political backing through low taxes and lax collection.</p> <p>Ending tax evasion, an unobjectionable goal in the abstract, would not prevent profligate states from spending their way into crisis. Nor would it merit the sacrifices in terms of freedom and human dignity the solution would demand. In any case, the most sophisticated and prolific tax avoiders would pursue technically legal means, the same as they do now. People who use cash to evade taxes hide thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in income; people who use offshore tax havens hide millions or tens of millions.</p> <p>Money laundering is a similar story: in a perfect world, it would be unknown. A perfectly surveilled remote-control currency could conceivably put a stop to criminals' washing their proceeds through cash businesses, since cash wouldn't exist. But the stereotypical picture of money laundering through nail salons, strip clubs, pizza shops, or the classic laundromats – while I have no doubt it occurs – distorts the picture terribly.</p> <p>Industrial-scale money laundering is performed not by these small, more or less seedy, cash-based businesses, but by huge multinational banks. These institutions are already subject to reams of regulation that require reporting and disclosure of 'suspicious' activity. They are as fully deputized to the financial surveillance apparatus as any sector could be, and yet the most cursory glance at their record in combating money laundering yields, well:<br /> </p> <ul> <li>'Wachovia pays $160 million to settle drug money probe' (2010)<sup><a href='#fn19' id='fnref19' epub:type='noteref'>19</a></sup></li> <li>'HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money-Laundering Charges' (2012)<sup><a href='#fn20' id='fnref20' epub:type='noteref'>20</a></sup></li> <li>'Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme' (2019)<sup><a href='#fn21' id='fnref21' epub:type='noteref'>21</a></sup></li> <li>'How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled' (2019)<sup><a href='#fn22' id='fnref22' epub:type='noteref'>22</a></sup></li> <li>'Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn23' id='fnref23' epub:type='noteref'>23</a></sup></li> <li>'Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn24' id='fnref24' epub:type='noteref'>24</a></sup></li> <li>'FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn25' id='fnref25' epub:type='noteref'>25</a></sup></li> <li>'Bank of America insider charged with money laundering for BEC scams' (2021)<sup><a href='#fn26' id='fnref26' epub:type='noteref'>26</a></sup></li> <li>'US families sue Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, accuse them of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan' (2021)<sup><a href='#fn27' id='fnref27' epub:type='noteref'>27</a></sup></li> <li>'Credit Suisse found guilty in cocaine cash laundering case' (2022)<sup><a href='#fn28' id='fnref28' epub:type='noteref'>28</a></sup></li> </ul> <p>It could be argued that these institutions, while subject to extensive and expensive post-9/11 know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, are simply ignoring them, and that imposing surveillance and control at the level of the individual transaction could force compliance.</p> <p>As it turns out, though, the failure isn't the banks' alone. For the most part, they conduct the surveillance required by the American government, filing millions of 'suspicious activity reports' (SARs) with FinCEN, the division of the Treasury Department tasked with combating money laundering, every year. Each SAR filing sets in motion an intricate protocol, as BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported in 2020, whereby the government ignores the reports and … the end.<sup><a href='#fn29' id='fnref29' epub:type='noteref'>29</a></sup></p> <p>According to a 2018 survey by the Bank Policy Institute, less than 4% of SARs 'warranted follow-up inquiries from law enforcement.'<sup><a href='#fn30' id='fnref30' epub:type='noteref'>30</a></sup></p> <p>This hollow ritual allows the banks to 'comply' with regulations by filing the proper forms and, when American regulators say nothing, continue to launder blood money. It allows American bureaucrats and politicians to claim to be fighting terrorists, drug dealers and mobsters. Occasionally, perhaps because a bank has failed to file the proper forms, the bureaucrats impose the sort of fine that banks can easily view as a cost of doing business. These 'enforcement actions' allow the bureaucracy to publish a press release and the politicians to rail against banks, whose campaign contributions they, for the most part, continue to accept.</p> <p>What the ritual does not accomplish is stopping Mexican or Colombian drug cartels, or kleptocrats in Soviet successor states, or jihadist terrorists, or the operators of Ponzi schemes from cleaning their money. The most commonly cited estimate for the effectiveness of global anti-money laundering controls is in the range of 0.1-0.2% – one or two dollars in every thousand.<sup><a href='#fn31' id='fnref31' epub:type='noteref'>31</a></sup> (This statistic also implies that other jurisdictions are no more effective than the U.S. in this regard.)</p> <p>What KYC/AML policies do accomplish is surveillance. FinCEN's 2020 report to Congress, in which it justifies its funding, repeatedly boasts that it has generated millions of reports of cash transactions, which are 'used to identify enforcement and investigative leads as well as strategic trends and patterns.'<sup><a href='#fn32' id='fnref32' epub:type='noteref'>32</a></sup> Plainly, however, money laundering continues apace. The purpose of KYC/AML laws as they exist today is to enhance government surveillance of the financial system.</p> <p>So it's no surprise that money laundering is being used to justify the creation of a system enabling total visibility into the entire field of economic activity: it's an old, successful playbook.</p> <p>Proponents of CBDCs frequently claim that their introduction (and cash's elimination) would solve some of the financial system's most persistent and acute problems. In a paper cited by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution claim that 'the widespread use of CBDC and the obsolescence of paper currency would be helpful in discouraging tax evasion, money laundering, and other illegal activities.'<sup><a href='#fn33' id='fnref33' epub:type='noteref'>33</a></sup></p> <p>The same claim is repeated in almost every favorable discussion of CBDCs, and it is almost certainly false. Particularly in the case of money laundering, policymakers have invoked the modern world's worst boogeymen to justify increasingly invasive scrutiny into individuals' finances. The system fails abjectly at accomplishing its stated goals,<sup><a href='#fn34' id='fnref34' epub:type='noteref'>34</a></sup> but succeeds in gaining visibility into people's transactions – visibility that would be denied under normal constitutional procedures, whereby authorities who want to spy on people need to obtain warrants.</p> <p>In an authoritarian tactic almost too cliché for parody, the state is demanding that we surrender basic freedoms in order to escape suspicion that we're drug dealers or terrorists.</p> <h3>The DMV</h3> <p>Similar logic has become so pervasive in the last couple of decades, it can be difficult to realize how strange and pernicious it really is.</p> <p>So imagine the same way of thinking applied to driving: when you go to the DMV to renew your license, you're handed a tracking device you must attach to your car. Your movements – all of them – are recorded in a DMV database. Any time you drive more than 10 miles, the data from the journey is automatically reported to local, state and federal law enforcement (no need for them to request it, much less obtain a warrant).</p> <p>If you travel more than 50 miles, or travel to a place you haven't been before, or make any stops in an area labeled 'suspicious' – there are many such areas, they change frequently, and you're responsible for knowing where they are – you need to file a Travel Justification Report and submit it to the DMV by fax. Repeated failure to do so could result in fines, suspension of your license, even jail time.</p> <p>It's universally recognized that everyone who drives violates the rules daily. It's wildly impractical to comply with them all, and perhaps, given their complexity and overlap, actually impossible. As a result, you or anyone else could be punished at any time. You have little prospect of defending yourself: of course you've broken the rules, everyone has. The best way to protect yourself is to have friends at the DMV and police precinct.</p> <p>Why are you being subjected to this bureaucratic lunacy? Because organized crime syndicates use roads to transport drugs. Because domestic extremists use roads to transport weapons and carry out terror attacks. Because human traffickers use roads to transport minors for sexual exploitation. What are you suggesting – that none of that <em>matters</em>? </p> <h3>The inevitable hack</h3> <p>I've struggled to find the appropriate place to weave this next point into the argument, so I've left it as an inelegant close to this chapter. Then again, perhaps it makes sense as a jarring coda: in a way, that's what a hack is.</p> <p>Even if every worry I've expressed so far about CBDCs is misplaced, one bad outcome is all but inevitable: a substantial amount of the sensitive, valuable data collected through this new form of money will leak. The government will do its best to avoid a breach, and sooner or later it will fail.</p> <p>Hackers will steal some or all of the transaction data, giving them potent leverage over people in positions of power, as well as countless ordinary people.</p> <p>Likely they'll be state-sponsored (hacking a government is generally not feasible for amateurs). There's precedent: beginning in 2014, Chinese government hackers obtained access to millions of personnel records held by the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management. The data was about as sensitive and valuable as any the state collects: it related to background checks conducted before granting security clearances to federal employees.<sup><a href='#fn35' id='fnref35' epub:type='noteref'>35</a></sup> Such a haul is perfectly suited to facilitating the blackmail of U.S. officials by its most powerful adversary's intelligence agents, and still the government could not protect that information.</p> <p>States should not be able to collect every detail of every payment conducted using their currency – because it's invasive, dangerous and unjust, but also because they can't be trusted to keep the data safe.</p> <p>Nor is a spectacular attack by a rival superpower always necessary to create a breach. In 2018, the Tribune<em> </em>reported that access to Aadhaar, India's universal biometric identification scheme, was on sale to anyone who could pay. The paper's reporters were able to purchase not just the personal details of an individual or some chunk of individuals, but permission to search the entire database, containing highly sensitive information on over a billion people. The price was less than $10.<sup><a href='#fn36' id='fnref36' epub:type='noteref'>36</a></sup></p> <h2>The freedom to transact is disappearing</h2> <p><em>As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.</em></p> <p>Chrystia Freeland</p> <p><br /></p> <p>You might see the previous chapter as overly anxious extrapolation from current trends, if not paranoid fantasy. I'm arguing that we've begun a slide into a state of profound unfreedom, in which the ability to obtain any good or service depends on the whims of the state, which – even if it's benevolent and wise for the moment (it's not) – could easily become uncaring, misguided or actively malicious.</p> <p>But even if you accept that we <em>could</em> slide into such a hell, you probably wish I'd offer some sort of evidence that the slide has begun. A lot of things <em>could </em>happen.</p> <p> Unfortunately, there is ample evidence that business and government leaders intend to introduce fully programmable, remote-control currencies, and to use this technology to pursue policy goals that large constituencies – if not majorities – of the people affected would oppose if given a say. To put it more bluntly: CBDCs are an end run around democratic processes – and potentially, a highly effective one.</p> <p>All the more so because, again unfortunately, the majority of the electorate in the average liberal democracy has little to no idea that such projects are being planned. CBDCs are no secret: I haven't smuggled sensitive documents out of some Washington sub-sub-basement. Central bankers have churned out discussion papers, white papers, proposals and plans related to CBDCs since around 2014,<sup><a href='#fn37' id='fnref37' epub:type='noteref'>37</a></sup> but the audience for this literature is the sort of person who knows what 'FOMC' stands for, what the FOMC does, and most of its members by name. To the vast majority, 'CBDC' is just one more in a sea of wonkish acronyms.</p> <p>Not infrequently, the financial media will report on these central bank publications, but the coverage is for the most part perfunctory and little more than a rewording of central bank statements – sometimes with a nod to abstract Concerns added for balance.</p> <p>Reuters' article on 'digital dollar' pilots announced in 2021 is a model of this sort of coverage: it presents CBDCs as a straightforward modernization project meant to 'improve payment systems' and 'boost financial inclusion'; the notes of caution – the need to protect 'privacy and freedom of commerce' – are provided by the NGO running the pilot and the central bank itself, not critics or even plausibly neutral observers.<sup><a href='#fn38' id='fnref38' epub:type='noteref'>38</a></sup></p> <p>I can only blame the media so much: interest in the topic simply isn't there. It's irrelevant to the culture wars that keep contemporary media in business (which is ironic, given how potent a weapon in those same culture wars CBDCs are likely to become).<sup><a href='#fn39' id='fnref39' epub:type='noteref'>39</a></sup></p> <p>And the source material, unsurprisingly, is sanitary fare. It takes a measure of skepticism and imagination to see how <em>the dollar,<strong> </strong>but digital</em> could empower states in ways they simply shouldn't be empowered. Perhaps, reporters, editors and readers alike could be forgiven for thinking, it takes a bit <em>too</em> much skepticism and imagination.</p> <p>But read the literature closely, and central bankers protest too much, making promises to maintain privacy and neutrality that inspire less confidence every time they're repeated. And sometimes, they make no such promises, laying out plainly how closely they intend to watch individual consumers' most quotidian transactions, and how they intend to censor the ones they deem undesirable.</p> <p>Nor would it be much comfort if central bankers sincerely desired to protect the freedom to transact. (They don't.) If the systems they implement don't enforce such protections at the protocol level – if human decision-making is the only safeguard – then sooner or later the decision-makers will abuse the powers these systems afford them. As Charlie Munger put it, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.</p> <p>For the time being, though, CBDCs remain in the discussion and planning phases. But even in the absence of CBDCs, we're faced with a growing list of concrete examples in which public- and private-sector actors abandon the principle – never so much a principle as the plain fact of a cash-first world – that money is a neutral medium. Private firms have increasingly adopted the view that, even though it violates no law or regulation, a given transaction should be subject to their approval, based on criteria they're free to devise in secret and revise on the fly. Politicians, bureaucrats and activists have encouraged these abuses, pushing firms to limit or revoke their customers' freedom to transact on transparently ideological grounds.</p> <p>CBDCs themselves, in other words, are not the whole issue. They are likely to be developed and adopted, but even if they aren't, powerful actors already possess the willingness and capability to limit the freedom to transact. The following examples deserve our attention because they demonstrate that fact, but also because they demonstrate the motivations, tactics and justifications of the people behind them – people who, if they themselves don't eventually control a CBDC, might inspire those who do.</p> <h3>Canada</h3> <p>In February 2022, in response to protests against covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates that saw truckers blockade economically important southern border crossings, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked a law granting the government sweeping emergency powers.<sup><a href='#fn40' id='fnref40' epub:type='noteref'>40</a></sup> Under this expanded remit, the government froze the financial assets of protesters and required credit card companies and fundraising platforms to report activity related to the protests to anti-money laundering authorities.</p> <p>Standing alongside Trudeau, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Finance, announced these measures at a press conference (emphasis mine):</p> <blockquote> <p>'In invoking the Emergencies Act, we are announcing the following immediate actions. First, we are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use. These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>'The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Our banks and financial institutions are already obligated to report to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FINTRAC.</p> <p>'As of today, all crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use must register with FINTRAC, and they must report large and suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. This will help mitigate the risk that these platforms receive illicit funds, increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC, and make more information available to support investigations by law enforcement into these illegal blockades.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy. The government will also bring forward legislation to provide these authorities to FINTRAC on a permanent basis.</p> <p>'Second, the government is issuing an order with immediate effect under the Emergencies Act authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts.</p> <p>'Third, we are directing Canadian financial institutions to review their relationships with anyone involved in the illegal blockades and report to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] or CSIS [Canadian Security Intelligence Service]. <em>As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.</em><br /> <br /> 'Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades. </p> <p>'This is about following the money. This is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades. We are today serving notice: if your truck is being used in these illegal blockades your corporate accounts will be frozen. The insurance on your vehicle will be suspended. Send your semi-trailers home. The Canadian economy needs them to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer.'<sup><a href='#fn41' id='fnref41' epub:type='noteref'>41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>I hope you'll pardon the long quotation. I see Freeland's address as some of the most valuable primary source material related to the topic of this essay, both because it will be remembered as a turning point in the history of liberal democracies (hopefully in the direction of stronger protections for the right to transact), and because it perfectly captures the rhetoric and mentality of those who support increased surveillance of and control over payments.</p> <p>Freeland presented the government's gathering more data on its citizens' transactions as a good in itself ('increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC'). She presented the new controls as an extension of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules. Since it's difficult to see how the protesters were laundering money (my understanding is that money launderers try to avoid drawing attention to themselves), that leaves two possibilities: the protesters were terrorists (she may in fact have meant to imply this) or, to my mind, the more likely conclusion – that these laws, with their distractingly villainous names, have little to do with terrorists or money laundering, and everything to do with dragnet surveillance.</p> <p>She made no attempt to present these measures as consistent with liberal democratic values, such as the presumption of innocence, the right to free assembly, or limitations on the government's ability to conduct searches and seizures.</p> <p>Instead, she made eight references to 'illegal blockades.' They almost certainly were illegal: civil disobedience is illegal by definition. But beyond that, there are limits to what any state or society can tolerate from its protesters, and the truckers may indeed have exceeded those limits. It's not my place to say. What I want to stress is that no court heard evidence regarding these protests or ruled them illegal. The laws they were accused of violating weren't specified. In the space of five minutes, a government minister declared the protesters' actions illegal; unveiled a new, unprecedented punishment for their crimes; and deputized private sector firms to root out and punish the perpetrators.</p> <p>Nor was it an idle threat. A week into the state of emergency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that they had frozen 219 financial products, as well as 3.8 million Canadian dollars held by a payment processor. (By that time, according to the government, the process of unfreezing assets had begun.)<sup><a href='#fn42' id='fnref42' epub:type='noteref'>42</a></sup></p> <p>Canada's actions have no antecedent that I'm aware of in modern liberal democracies, but even so they elicited muted criticism. Mainstream outlets, at least in the U.S., paid little attention to this innovation in the maintenance of public order: using information obtained through warrantless surveillance of the financial system to cut off protesters' access to credit cards and bank accounts.</p> <p>The lack of any official condemnation from other Western governments suggests they might at least consider pursuing similar measures to break up protests against their own policies. To state the obvious, there is no guarantee that such weaponization of the financial system will be limited to left-of-center governments like Trudeau's, or its victims to those aligned with the political right. Once these tools become available to them, governments of any persuasion will gladly use them against protesters of any description.</p> <p>Canadians will almost certainly hesitate to attend protests critical of the government from now on, since they know that they can be arrested and denied the means to pay bail – indeed, pay for anything. Their right to free assembly has been effectively eliminated, without any need to pass a law or create a spectacle through physical confrontations. </p> <p>The people of other ostensibly liberal democracies might soon experience the same chilling effect, to the extent they haven't already, having seen Canada's example.</p> <h3>PayPal</h3> <p>Often, financial services providers are happy to surveil and punish their customers for the sorts of infractions the Canadian authorities went after, but without any prompting from the government. (At least, any public prompting.)</p> <p>PayPal, a private payment processor, has for years enforced an idiosyncratic moral code based not on the laws of any jurisdiction it happens to operate in, but its own opaque Terms of Service regime.</p> <p>In 2020, Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director at the non-profit crypto advocacy group Coin Center, compiled a list of examples in which PayPal barred users from its platform for engaging in perfectly legal activity: OnlyFans models were prohibited from selling nude photos on the platform; independent journalists tracking the spread of covid in prisons were kicked off when Twitter flagged them for spreading misinformation; a website publishing files for 3D printing guns (protected speech) and selling related merch was banned (their Twitter account is also suspended).<sup><a href='#fn43' id='fnref43' epub:type='noteref'>43</a></sup> </p> <p>The ACLU has criticized PayPal for barring sex workers.<sup><a href='#fn44' id='fnref44' epub:type='noteref'>44</a></sup> The company was accused of stalling efforts to raise bail money for Black Lives Matter protesters.<sup><a href='#fn45' id='fnref45' epub:type='noteref'>45</a></sup> It shut a user out for making payments related to Tor nodes he was hosting.<sup><a href='#fn46' id='fnref46' epub:type='noteref'>46</a></sup> A Canadian news outlet's payment for an article about Syrian refugees was blocked – apparently for mentioning the word 'Syria.'<sup><a href='#fn47' id='fnref47' epub:type='noteref'>47</a></sup> PayPal froze WikiLeaks' account in 2010.<sup><a href='#fn48' id='fnref48' epub:type='noteref'>48</a></sup></p> <p>Recently, the company went beyond keeping users' funds in limbo, and signaled its intention to actually seize money from users who fall afoul of its rules.</p> <p>In October 2022 PayPal said it would levy steep fines for a range of activities, including speech the company deemed unacceptable.<sup><a href='#fn49' id='fnref49' epub:type='noteref'>49</a></sup> The language of the updated 'Acceptable Use Policy,' which would have gone into force the following month, labeled the 'sending, posting, or publication of messages, content, or materials that meet certain criteria' as 'prohibited activities' that could result in fines of $2,500. Among these 'certain criteria' was content found to 'promote misinformation.'</p> <p>A company whose purpose – at least in its customers' eyes – is to process payments, has taken upon itself the duty to monitor its customers' speech, judge that speech's merits according to criteria known to no one outside the company (in all likelihood, never explicitly defined anywhere), and if the speech is found wanting, seize its customers' funds as punishment.</p> <p>To be clear, the procedure envisioned in this document wasn't to freeze funds or bar access to the platform. PayPal would have gone beyond even Canada's emergency measures and permanently confiscated its customers' money. (The document was pulled from PayPal's website, and the company claimed the proposed change was an 'error.')</p> <p>If a state took these actions, we would be rightly outraged, but hardly surprised. Monarchs, emperors, high priests, generals and the like have all too frequently done this sort of thing. In enforcing their vision of truth, they've used economic measures along with other, grislier tactics. One could name any number of examples from any number of places, going back as far as recorded history permits.</p> <p>For a private company to adopt this attitude, though, is strange. Having your assets confiscated for heresy is one thing, if the Church or King is doing it. If a democracy is doing it, you might (but shouldn't) comfort yourself with the notion that at least the censorship is of, by and for the people. For an online payments service to act this way, though, is something else entirely. PayPal is not a democratically accountable institution. Nor does any sort of social contract exist that could conceivably give it the right to punish crimes of conscience.</p> <p>The situation is just silly. PayPal isn't yet 30 years old. It has 'pal' in the name. For an institution of this type to freelance as Ministry of Truth would be a farce, except that it's part of a definite trend: Facebook, Google and Twitter have taken it upon themselves to determine – according to inconsistent, flighty standards that make scant reference to constitutional principles – what may and may not be said.</p> <h3>Third parties</h3> <p>Why should these companies be empowered to enforce a superset of the law? It seems law enforcement bodies themselves have provided some of the impetus.</p> <p>Cops in constitutional democracies are in theory constrained by protections like the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure. But American authorities, at least, have a convenient way around these hurdles: once a person voluntarily provides a third party with information (the way PayPal's customers provide it with their payments data), constitutional strictures fall away. Law enforcement can simply ask the company for the data, with no need to seek a search warrant from a court.</p> <p>The company could refuse, of course, in which case the authorities are back to petitioning judges through the normal procedure envisioned in the Bill of Rights. But from the perspective of a heavily regulated financial services company, how is it in your interest to stand up for your customers' rights? The politicians and regulators who can make or break your thin margins with a couple well-aimed laws or rules don't, with rare exceptions, care about your customers' privacy. They actively resent it, to the extent it makes catching criminals, terrorists and 'extremists' – a term that tends to cover the whole of the political opposition – more difficult.</p> <p>One might expect voters to enforce a concern for constitutional protections by electing lawmakers who care about such protections: after all, these voters are almost all customers of one or more financial services firms. But by and large, the electorate doesn't care either. They too would like to catch criminals, terrorists and extremists, and this is a perfectly healthy instinct.</p> <p><em>If you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide</em>, authoritarian politicians argue, and in the main, voters agree. This logic presupposes, however, a reasonable and humane definition of 'wrong.' Practically everyone in a modern democratic society qualifies as a criminal and extremist by the standards of the sort of authoritarian regime that governed broad swathes of the globe in the 20th century.</p> <p>Considering voters' (and customers') indifference to cooperation between law enforcement and data-rich financial service providers, the clear interest law enforcement has in cultivating such cooperation, and the regulatory hostility companies can expect if they resist, it's hardly surprising that PayPal should volunteer to enforce not just the law, but the preferences of government officials.</p> <p>PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy reads as if the company has been deputized by the authorities to enforce the laws they wish existed, as well as the ones that actually do. Item one under the heading 'Prohibited Activities' covers those that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Fair enough. There then follow a couple dozen <em>other</em> prohibited activities and yet more which require pre-approval.<sup><a href='#fn50' id='fnref50' epub:type='noteref'>50</a></sup> </p> <p>The obvious question is not addressed: why should PayPal restrict payments for legal goods and services – even 'items that are considered obscene?'</p> <p>Of course as a private company they're within their rights to do so. Customers can take their business elsewhere, the logic runs. But when most if not all financial services providers are similarly cowed into acting as freelance police, what is the alternative?<br /> <br /> It's also worth interrogating the justification for companies behaving this way: they're private, true, but they're also some of the most heavily regulated firms in the private sector. Legislators and bureaucrats have long felt comfortable placing significant constraints on these companies' behavior. They could, I imagine, mandate that firms only censor transactions when actual laws are being violated, but they don't. </p> <p>The result is a system that enables enforcement without legislation. A legal but <em>obscene</em> activity rubs law enforcement the wrong way. It is made known that payments related to such activities are <em>risky</em> for firms to process, so they don't. Replicated across the economy, this cycle creates de facto law without the need for democratic debate, legislative process or judicial scrutiny. These pseudo-laws can't be challenged or repealed – or even, usually, read. They are codified, if at all, through vague, sweeping references in terms of service agreements that can change at any time without notice. </p> <p>The victims of this system are the small but growing class of 'debanked' people, who almost never find out why their bank – sometimes multiple banks – have severed ties with them. One day their cards stop working, they slog through their bank's customer service morass, and in the end they still have no idea why they've been deemed unworthy of an account.</p> <p>In 2023, Naafeh Dhillon told the New York Times that his card was rejected one evening, and all Chase would tell him was that 'unexpected activity' had led to all of his accounts being closed.<sup><a href='#fn51' id='fnref51' epub:type='noteref'>51</a></sup> 'I received no kind of warning or red flag,' Dhillon said. (Money sent by his Pakistani parents while he was in college was put forward as a potential culprit.)</p> <p>Another Chase customer said he'd been unable to find out why he was dropped as a customer even after three years. </p> <p>A Synchrony customer told the paper that his funds had been frozen because – he was able to wring the reason from the bank – of an out-of-state attempt to log into his account. He made the attempt; he was traveling.</p> <p>Recall Alice, the hypothetical CBDC user I invented to illustrate the horror of being locked out of using one's national currency. Her money became unavailable one day, and she had no means of finding out why or reversing the decision. This sort of thing happens today, and appears to be happening more often.</p> <p>Lawyers write expansive, moralizing terms of service that allow for the removal of any even remotely <em>risky</em> customer. Programmers and – to the extent AI is involved in the process, programs – translate these rules into automated systems that comb customer data for <em>unexpected activity</em>. Law enforcement, as I mentioned above, is only remotely interested in perhaps 4% of these alerts, but there's no question of letting the justice system sort out who's guilty of wrongdoing. Anyone the banks remotely suspect of anything, they simply kick out. Why take the risk?<br /> <br /> There's no reason to expect CBDCs to operate differently. Who will build the compliance and risk management systems, after all, if not the people who built them for the banks? The only difference will be that when the central bank debanks people, they'll have no legal way to buy or sell anything. </p> <h3>The misinformation hunt</h3> <p>A trend that, for the time being, is mostly unrelated to the financial sector provides a compelling reason to worry about the freedom to transact.</p> <p>The past decade has seen the emergence of concerted activist efforts aimed at technology companies, originating from within their ranks as well as outside – from NGOs, universities, and the government. The details of the agenda – which is far from unified – change frequently, and often on a dime, but 'progressive' is the label activists generally use, and anyone passingly familiar with the political discourse knows more or less what that term indicates in a given moment.</p> <p>Progressive campaigns have focused most heavily on social media companies, where the goal is to 'deplatform' – that is, censor – unacceptable speech. Such speech includes racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry, with the crucial caveat that such labels are applied with shocking liberality: statements that would have occasioned no remark in the most progressive circles five or ten years ago frequently meet with shrieking denunciations today. Even inaction, declining to join in the denunciations or to express full-throated support for any number of mercurial shibboleths raises hackles. <em>Silence</em>, a common slogan has it, <em>is violence.</em><br /> <br /> And if silence is violence, so of course is speech. And if dissent of either sort – spoken or tacit – is violence, it must be stopped by any means necessary, including real, physical violence. Once this line of thinking is pursued to its logical extreme, the usual brakes on censorship are easily dismissed as irrelevant, absurd – even, through a neat trick whereby the people stripping civil rights from their political enemies become the victims, <em>fascist</em>. </p> <p>Practically all of the speech the deplatformers would silence enjoys First Amendment protection. They bat away that objection. Much of the speech is factually accurate, and the deplatformers know that. No matter. If it doesn't conform to their ideological requirements, it is violence, or if that label doesn't fit, <em>misinformation</em> (also, <em>disinformation</em>).<sup><a href='#fn52' id='fnref52' epub:type='noteref'>52</a></sup> </p> <p>It has proven not just possible, but trivial, to censor disfavored voices with little to no justification beyond the invocation of that single word – <em>misinformation – </em>despite all the constitutional protections we might reasonably expect to stand in the way.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this expedient has proven popular not just with activists, but politicians, bureaucrats and law enforcement.</p> <p>The Twitter Files, published in 2023 by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, have revealed that those engaged in the fight against bad speech often acknowledge privately that the posts they are censoring are factual (misinformation that's accurate has been given a special designation by censorship practitioners: <em>malinformation</em>).<sup><a href='#fn53' id='fnref53' epub:type='noteref'>53</a></sup> They justify their inventions based on the risk that the facts could 'exacerbate distrust' in people and institutions they wish to defend.<sup><a href='#fn54' id='fnref54' epub:type='noteref'>54</a></sup> </p> <p>Perhaps more important is who<em> </em>these misinformation fighters are. A few years ago, it was reasonable to assume that social media censorship was carried out by employees of the platforms due to pressure from, or sympathy with, activists.</p> <p>The Twitter Files have exposed that assumption as hopelessly naïve. They have demonstrated active collaboration between employees of every major social media platform;<sup><a href='#fn55' id='fnref55' epub:type='noteref'>55</a></sup> universities including Stanford and NYU; the National Conference on Citizenship, a federally chartered non-profit; and the Centers for Disease Control. Among the sources of funding for the partners involved in one such program – called the Virality Project, its focus was removing disfavored speech related to covid – are the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation.</p> <p>Participants in this effort called for (and obtained) the creation of a 'Disinformation Governance Board' within the Department of Homeland Security. Calling this body a 'Ministry of Truth' or some other Orwellian label doesn't really enhance the impact: its real name is already apex-Orwellian.<sup><a href='#fn56' id='fnref56' epub:type='noteref'>56</a></sup></p> <p>Other revelations in the Twitter Files detail cooperation between Twitter employees and the FBI, as well as the White House. The company repeatedly acceded to requests from these entities to censor legal speech, including speech related to the 2020 presidential election.<sup><a href='#fn57' id='fnref57' epub:type='noteref'>57</a></sup></p> <p>Another source of insight into government censorship of social media is <em>Missouri v. Biden</em>, a lawsuit brought by that state's attorney general, together with other plaintiffs, against the Biden administration. The discovery process in that suit has unearthed extensive evidence of First Amendment violations by the federal bureaucracy, much of it overlapping with the content of the Twitter files.<sup><a href='#fn58' id='fnref58' epub:type='noteref'>58</a></sup></p> <p>A few details add color to the overall picture: the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acted as a 'switchboard' for the censorship efforts of several executive departments, facilitating meetings that included 'DHS, FBI, U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Microsoft, and Verizon Media.'<br /> <br /> The head of CISA, justifying the agency's role in coordinating censorship, argued that its mandate to protect infrastructure includes 'cognitive infrastructure' – that is, speech – and that 'it's really, really dangerous if people get to pick their own facts.' (The government, presumably, should be the sole arbiter of what is true.) </p> <p>The plaintiffs note that the Census Bureau and the Treasury Department were also involved in flagging so-called misinformation to remove from social media sites. The Treasury's efforts, according to DHS documents, focused on 'public confidence' in the financial system. (I'm willing to bet that the contents of this essay constitute misinformation according to the standards of the Treasury's inquisitors.)<br /> <br /> The Virality Project, mentioned above, 'provided strategic insights to government entities such as the OSG [Office of the Surgeon General], CDC, and the Department of Health and Human Services,' according to the complaint. The OSG in particular pressured Facebook and other social media companies to remove content related to covid. </p> <p>The suit also details the government's coordination with platforms to remove election-related posts. Much of this was conducted through the Election Integrity Partnership, a Stanford-affiliated 'non-partisan coalition' that makes no mention, at least publicly, of having been set up by CISA. (According to the complaint, this is 'simply another moniker' for the Virality Project; both refer to the same teams engaged in the same activities.)</p> <p>To be clear: the executive branch, overseen by the president, created an organization to censor content related to presidential elections.</p> <p>Elections being the main constitutional means of replacing the president and preventing him or her from staying on for life, I'd argue that people holding that office shouldn't be allowed to dictate what can and can't be said about elections. The fact that the effort was presented as purely academic and unaffiliated with the government is all the more galling.</p> <p>What could justify such antidemocratic behavior on the part of the government? They were putting a stop to violence of course. Except this violence, like so much of the 'violence' people are accused of these days, was simply to speech – or more precisely, hesitance to curtail others' speech. In July 2021, Biden publicly accused platforms of 'killing people' by allowing users to post alleged misinformation related to covid. Shortly thereafter the White House threatened to revisit legislation exempting platforms from legal liability for information users post there. Social media companies responded with a flurry of activity, reviewing or taking down posts and accounts the government had (privately) expressed distaste for.</p> <p>The plaintiffs in the suit also note that the government has moved beyond policing election- and covid-related posts, branching into 'climate change, 'gendered disinformation,' abortion and economic policy' as well as 'racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.'</p> <p>No single thread runs through all of these topics, except current-year partisan politics, meaning in essence that the White House feels at liberty to order the removal of any content from any social media platform, so long as it disagrees with the political stance of the content.</p> <p>We're presented with further evidence that misinformation – as a non-<em>expert</em> might describe it – is not the real concern. Facebook's parent company Meta (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) reassured the White House that it will target 'non-violative content, such as discussing the choice to vaccinate in terms of personal or civil liberties.' The factuality – forget the constitutionally protected status – of the content is not considered important; rather the acceptable line has been laid down (<em>vaccines are safe and effective</em>) and any challenge to that line, even if grounded in reality, must be removed.</p> <p>And just to emphasize something that's easy to miss in the foregoing: discussions of civil liberties were explicitly singled out for removal, itself a violation of civil liberties.</p> <p>A coordinated censorship campaign embracing social media companies, numerous government agencies, universities, law enforcement bodies, NGOs, the military, the White House, and miscellaneous activists already exists. Its participants are pleased with their success so far in curtailing constitutionally protected expression and plan to expand their efforts to any topic they deem politically salient, not stopping at elections themselves.</p> <p>It would be appealing and no doubt rather simple for the censors to expand along another axis, from social media platforms into payment systems. As Taibbi noted in a statement delivered to Congress, 'ordinary Americans are not just being reported to Twitter for 'deamplification' or de-platforming, but to firms like PayPal [...] and crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.'<sup><a href='#fn59' id='fnref59' epub:type='noteref'>59</a></sup></p> <p>The financial services sector is joining the misinformation crusade.</p> <h3>JPMorgan Chase</h3> <p>Ignoring Canada, banks don't yet condition their services on customers' holding acceptable views, at least to my knowledge.<sup><a href='#fn60' id='fnref60' epub:type='noteref'>60</a></sup> There appears to have been a high-profile exception to the rule, however, and it could be a sign of things to come.</p> <p>JPMorgan Chase closed Kanye 'Ye' West's accounts after the artist made a string of explicitly antisemitic comments in the fall of 2022.<sup><a href='#fn61' id='fnref61' epub:type='noteref'>61</a></sup> West's rhetoric – including a threat to go 'death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE' – escalated in the weeks following his bank's decision to cut ties, and before long he was publicly indulging in unambiguous praise for Hitler.</p> <p>If there were ever speech that merited ejection from the financial system, I suppose this would be it. It is cartoonishly villainous to glorify one of history's greatest mass murderers and menace one of the communities he singled out for physical extermination. But accepting such a premise – that access to banking is subject to an ideological test of any sort – is fundamentally illiberal, and down the line it poses a greater threat to freedom and justice than some obviously unwell celebrity's embrace of Nazism.</p> <p>Now JPMorgan Chase, to my knowledge, is at perfect liberty, legally speaking, to end its relationship with Ye for this or any number of reasons. (Nor, to my knowledge, is there any proof that Ye's comments were the reason for the bank's decision.)</p> <p>But as with PayPal, such decisions set a precedent that withholding the ability to transact is an effective and convenient means of social control. It's difficult to argue that the people running a private business – bank executives, say – should be compelled to provide services to someone they don't want as a customer. They should enjoy their own freedoms, after all.</p> <p>But in the realm of finance and payments, the line between the state and private business breaks down before it's even drawn. Personnel move freely between Wall Street C-suites and the Treasury, along with any number of ministries of finance and financial regulatory bodies around the world. Just 15 years ago, American taxpayers bailed out the world's largest banks. A century before that, the country's richest bankers bailed out the American government.</p> <p>It's far from surprising that when Canada ordered banks to summarily freeze the accounts of anti-lockdown protesters, the banks complied without a (public) word of complaint.</p> <p>Nor is it surprising that PayPal acts as freelance private-sector law enforcement, doing its best to crack down on activities without asking the government to trouble itself with obtaining warrants or even making specific requests. Often enough, the activities aren't illegal, so law enforcement would have little hope of following the constitutionally prescribed procedure.</p> <p>Returning to Ye, though: should we shed a tear for the man in a ski mask extolling Hitler's contributions to civilization?<sup><a href='#fn62' id='fnref62' epub:type='noteref'>62</a></sup> I don't plan to, but nor should we let contempt for this specific individual cloud our vision of the principles at stake. If only people who sank to such a level were targeted for financial exclusion, I doubt much practical damage would result. The world might even marginally improve.</p> <p>But authoritarian overreach often targets the least sympathetic figures first, then, once it's gained momentum, moves towards the center. The 18th-century French revolutionaries began by defining an aristocrat as French society always had: a titular member of the nobility, recognized as such by clergy, commoners and other aristocrats alike. Many of the revolutionaries being aristocrats themselves, they weren't generally bent on killing the whole caste.</p> <p>Within a few years, however, an 'aristocrat' could be anyone, commoner, noble or priest, unfortunate enough to fall foul of the mob. The virtuous revolutionary 'citizen' denouncing this aristocrat could be a member of the nobility who had renounced their title.<sup><a href='#fn63' id='fnref63' epub:type='noteref'>63</a></sup> 'Aristocrat' was simply shorthand for a counterrevolutionary, a heretic. To be labeled one was to be one – no daylight shone between accusation and conviction – and to be one was to deserve death.</p> <p>We might consider the case of Ye's interviewer in the ski mask incident, who practically pleaded with the artist to express at least some reservation regarding the Third Reich. Alex Jones is not generally known as a voice of reason. He is notorious for a years-long campaign meant to discredit and torment – of all people – the parents of victims of an elementary school shooting. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly then, when Jones was removed from all major internet platforms in 2018,<sup><a href='#fn64' id='fnref64' epub:type='noteref'>64</a></sup> words of protest were few and far between. Who could regard the slippery slope of censorship with such dread that they'd defend the Sandy Hook truther?</p> <p>But there were those who warned that the same fate would befall more and more people, for less and less heinous speech, and they were correct.<sup><a href='#fn65' id='fnref65' epub:type='noteref'>65</a></sup> Today people are routinely removed from social platforms for posting 'misinformation.' As noted above, in many if not most cases, this speech is a matter of opinion, and in a sizable minority of cases, the 'misinformation' is factually correct, but considered somehow unseemly.</p> <p>Debates over the effectiveness of covid vaccines brought many such cases to light. As Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023:</p> <blockquote> <p>'take some of the stuff around covid earlier on in the pandemic, where there were real health implications, but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions, and unfortunately I think a lot of the kind of establishment on that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true.'<sup><a href='#fn66' id='fnref66' epub:type='noteref'>66</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>It's not necessary, however, to make analogies to social media platforms to argue that financial deplatforming will hit a slippery slope. PayPal started sloping long ago, moving from policing sex work to policing speech.</p> <h3>Guns, porn and abortion</h3> <p>The reasons behind PayPal or JPMorgan's actions can be guessed at, but the conversations that precipitated them are opaque and will probably stay that way. In some cases, though, financial deplatforming – or steps in that direction – are clearly the result of long and targeted activist campaigns.</p> <p>In September 2022, Visa, Amex and Mastercard agreed to categorize gun sales differently from other 'general merchandise' purchases, the category under which such sales previously fell.</p> <p>This added surveillance allows credit card companies to 'flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammunition are sold,' according to the Associated Press, which described the development as a 'significant win' for gun control advocates.<sup><a href='#fn67' id='fnref67' epub:type='noteref'>67</a></sup></p> <p>To state the obvious, these activists aren't elected, so they can't be removed from office by voters. They aren't businesses, so they can't be pushed to change course by customers (though customers can and should punish the businesses that cave to such activists' demands).</p> <p>These groups aren't directly accountable to ordinary people who need to make and receive payments, yet they're able to constrain these people's freedom to transact. They do so in order to make it more difficult to engage in legal activities that, in the activists' opinion, shouldn't be legal. Rather than accept the outcome of the democratic process and continue campaigning for stricter gun control, such groups enforce their preferred version of the law by lobbying for changes to the internal processes of financial platforms: legislation by other means.</p> <p>Given the success of this technique, it's a matter of time before pressure groups subject a wider range of legal purchases to added scrutiny, without the hassle of winning elections and passing laws.</p> <p>The editor of a Catholic news outlet spoke to Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in 2023, pressing him to consider whether the company was 'funding' the sexual exploitation of minors by processing users' payments to PornHub.<sup><a href='#fn68' id='fnref68' epub:type='noteref'>68</a></sup></p> <p>Pro-choice activists have expressed justifiable concerns that opponents of abortion, another politically charged issue, are likely to seek out payments data in order to punish women who obtain the procedure. In 2022, after decades of campaigning on the issue and pushing for the nomination of Supreme Court justices who would overturn a 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, pro-life activists managed to ban it outright in several U.S. states.<sup><a href='#fn69' id='fnref69' epub:type='noteref'>69</a></sup> </p> <p>Women in these places are able to travel to other states to have the procedure (though in practice this isn't always feasible), and some advocates of the ban wish to prosecute those who do so. Payments data is a convenient way to gather evidence for such prosecutions.</p> <p>Contacted by the New York Times, few payments providers would say what they would do in response to subpoenas from, say, Texas authorities seeking information on a woman's financial activity. Experts interviewed by the paper pointed out that courts could potentially order companies to turn the data over, as well as issuing gag orders to prevent them from alerting the woman alleged to have sought the abortion. She in turn could face jail time.<sup><a href='#fn70' id='fnref70' epub:type='noteref'>70</a></sup></p> <p>Explaining the precedents for such subpoenas, the Times wrote, 'Card issuers have grown used to requests for user data in terrorism, money-laundering and illegal-trafficking investigations.' The slope slippens.</p> <h3>The war on cash</h3> <p>Of course, the authorities' and activists' ability to exploit payment rails as a chokepoint goes out the window if people simply pay cash. Unsurprisingly, then, the state is making efforts to curtail its use. It's common to hear politicians and policy wonks disparage the evils of 'dirty' paper money: dirty both in the literal sense, of germ-carrying bills, and more importantly in the figurative sense, of filthy lucre obtained illicitly.</p> <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetization of large rupee notes in 2016 had the stated aim of flushing 'black money' out of the economy and moving towards a 'cashless society.'<sup><a href='#fn71' id='fnref71' epub:type='noteref'>71</a></sup> The move caused immense disruption, forcing millions to line up outside of banks and ATMs (over a hundred people reportedly died in these lines). What it did not do was eliminate cash or leave the beneficiaries of crime and corruption stranded: essentially all demonetized notes were exchanged, so 99.3% of the dirty money blighting the Indian economy before demonetization continued to circulate afterwards.<sup><a href='#fn72' id='fnref72' epub:type='noteref'>72</a></sup></p> <p>It's common to envision a near future in which cash has been eliminated entirely, but that's not to say it's an edgy or futuristic vision: people simply assume at some level that cash's time is limited. What use, outside of crime, could grubby paper notes have in an otherwise digital world?</p> <p>While it's possible that these assumptions are the natural product of the internet and smartphones, we can't be sure, because we can't ignore the effect of decades of legislation aimed at limiting the use of cash to small, everyday transactions.</p> <p>In a piece published by Coin Center, University of Virginia Law School adjunct professor Abraham Sutherland details the history, effects and intention of the law's most powerful disincentive against the use of cash: section 6050I of the U.S. tax code, passed in 1984.<sup><a href='#fn73' id='fnref73' epub:type='noteref'>73</a></sup></p> <p>Today, Sutherland writes, due to this provision and its subsequent expansions and revisions, 'if you use large amounts of physical currency, there's something wrong with you, and it's probably that you're a criminal. It's such a legally fraught hassle that there's no other explanation.'</p> <p>In 1970, in an effort to combat or be seen to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, banks were required to report cash transactions over $10,000, the equivalent of $65,000 today. In 1984, anyone performing commercial transactions was required to report similarly sized transactions by the passage of section 6050I. This allowed law enforcement to go after drug dealers for failure to report cash income, particularly after 1988, when violations were upgraded to felonies. (According to Sutherland, this is the only information reporting requirement carrying felony penalties.)</p> <p>This change to tax law massively enhanced the state's capacity for financial surveillance. Whatever its intended purpose, this has become the law's most consequential effect, and the state has strengthened the statute in order to enhance this capacity further.</p> <p>The reporting requirement has become a window, easily available to law enforcement of any description, into the financial lives of Americans. Any cash transaction of more-than-quotidian importance now must be shared with the tax authorities, who of course are normally barred from violating taxpayers' confidentiality. But the exception to this rule, passed by Congress in 1988, is Form 8300, the form the IRS requires anyone receiving $10,000 or more to file.</p> <p>The Treasury can share your Form 8300 with employees of any federal agency or, as of 1996, any agency of any state or local – even foreign – government. Nor do these lax controls actually limit how widely cash transaction data can be shared: in 2001, Congress copy-pasted the text of 6050I into the Bank Secrecy Act, requiring the same information be shared with FinCEN, who can then treat it with even less regard for privacy than the IRS does.</p> <p>Cash transaction reporting requirements militate against the logic of normal commerce. To accept, say, $20,000 in cash in exchange for some good or service requires a seller to verify their counterparty's government ID, obtain their Social Security number and date of birth, record their occupation, and describe the transaction. The seller then signs the form under penalty of perjury and mails it to the IRS in at most 15 days. Failure to meet this high bar of peer-to-peer surveillance on behalf of the government can result in a $25,000 fine or five years in prison.</p> <p>Sutherland depicts what navigating it routinely might be like for a law-abiding business owner who wants to deal in cash. I suggest reading it; it's maddening. His point, though, is that such business owners are hypothetical. They do not and cannot exist, because at some point, they must give up on either cash or compliance. So cash is in practice an illegal medium of payment for businesses, unless they limit themselves to accepting it from customers in small amounts – the way a restaurant might – and immediately depositing it to a bank account.</p> <p>This burdensome process encourages anyone not dealing in organs harvested from the living to simply use banks. But the process reveals something about the role of banks, at least from the government's perspective: the high-fidelity surveillance that merchants are required to perform on their counterparties is simply the level of surveillance the state can expect its compliant financial sector to perform on its behalf. Banks are an extension of law enforcement.</p> <p>By making banks mandatory for businesses that wish to operate legally, the tax authorities assure they don't miss out on too many revenue-raising opportunities, and law enforcement enjoys a detailed view into ordinary people's financial dealings, without the hassle of petitioning courts for warrants.</p> <p>With the introduction of cash-like payment apps, the effort to surveil all possible transactions has expanded. The IRS now requires platforms such as Venmo and PayPal to report commercial payments totalling over $600 per year.<sup><a href='#fn74' id='fnref74' epub:type='noteref'>74</a></sup> The previous requirement was to report payments numbering 200 or more and totalling over $20,000. As inflation – which is touching multi-decade highs at the time of writing – does its work, this threshold decreases in real terms until, in a few years, any but the tiniest purchases must legally be disclosed to the government. </p> <p>The Netherlands has proposed a law that would lower the threshold to €100.<sup><a href='#fn75' id='fnref75' epub:type='noteref'>75</a></sup> The European Central Bank has stopped producing €500 notes. Justifications for this move in the press generally invoked the worst boogeymen of our era: jihadists, drug cartels and organized crime.<sup><a href='#fn76' id='fnref76' epub:type='noteref'>76</a></sup></p> <p>And yet the change arose not with any noticeable surge in the activity of any of these actors, but with a failure to square a policy circle: desiring to implement negative interest rates (the historically unprecedented practice of borrowers charging lenders interest), policymakers realized that rather than watch their bank deposits erode, savers would simply withdraw cash. What better way to prevent that outcome than to accuse aggrieved savers of consorting with society's worst villains?</p> <p>Businesses that deal in large amounts of cash – or rather, that might otherwise deal in large amounts of cash – find themselves saddled with so much paperwork and subject to such scrutiny and suspicion, that the state's hostility to this least-surveillable form of money is clear.</p> <p>In Europe and North America, the vice is tightening slowly. It is becoming idiosyncratic and inconvenient to spend more than a couple hundred dollars' worth of cash at a time, but the authorities have not gone so far as to actively clamp down on its use.<sup><a href='#fn77' id='fnref77' epub:type='noteref'>77</a></sup> </p> <h3>The exception that proves the rule</h3> <p>I've argued that even the most authoritarian regimes haven't historically contemplated enforcing ideological and behavioral conformity through the surveillance and censorship of economic transactions, not because the idea doesn't appeal, but because it was never technologically feasible. And I've argued that soon the technology will be in place for them to do just that.</p> <p>You may be skeptical; I would be too. The whole line of thinking has a whiff of <em>this time is different</em>. Why should you take these threats seriously when I can cite no precedent over millennia of rich and varied modes of oppression?</p> <p>I have found one example, and given that superficially similar situations have occurred throughout history, there may be a few others out there.</p> <p>When the American-allied South Vietnamese government based in Saigon fell to the communist North in 1975, the newly arrived, unabashedly authoritarian government found itself in a position to implement the sort of economic surveillance and censorship I've described. Having suffered a complete military defeat, the people of Saigon were dependent on the occupiers for food and essentials. The government issued ration cards, but revoked them from anyone who expressed opposition to the new regime.</p> <p>The North Vietnamese communists of course lacked the programmable digital money of 202X – no matter. In the situation created by South Vietnam's implosion, they were able to arbitrarily exclude people from participation in the economy using analog means. Enemies of the new government found themselves unable to obtain basic necessities through state-sanctioned channels.<sup><a href='#fn78' id='fnref78' epub:type='noteref'>78</a></sup> </p> <p>Restricting the means of exchange to friendly, compliant actors is a concept that comes naturally enough to oppressive states. Given even a relatively fleeting opportunity to do so, they'll take advantage of it. While the fall of Saigon is the only situation I've encountered that seems to fit this situation cleanly, I doubt that the North Vietnamese occupiers were uniquely creative in adopting the strategy they did: issuing a currency to a population that's used to it, but for whatever reason lacks it, opens up valuable political opportunities to mete out rewards and punishments.</p> <p>The main caveat, of course, is that such situations are likely to be temporary. As a normal cash economy reasserts itself, analog means of locking people out fail. CBDCs, though, might prove more successful in this regard.</p> <h3>CBDCs</h3> <p>Watching banks freeze accounts and payment processors censor transactions based on political considerations is disturbing, but it's piecemeal. Where such actions stem from government pressure, we can comfort ourselves with the not-implausible thought that some firms will resist the pressure. As for the activists within and outside these firms, who push them to weaponize their offerings in service of some cause, causes lose momentum. The ecosystem heals.</p> <p>For us to take comfort from this notion, though, there must <em>be </em>an ecosystem. Some number of banks and payments processors, whatever exactly that number is, must be in competition, so that customer desires factor into their decision making – not just regulatory menace and cancel-happy mobs.</p> <h4>The neutrality of money</h4> <p>For that situation to exist, money itself needs to be neutral. Deposit it to JPMorgan, Bank of America, TDBank or Wells Fargo. Send it via PayPal, ACH or an envelope stuffed with cash – it's all the same dollar. One bank might give you trouble when you try to transact with certain parties, but it's not the currency itself at the root of the trouble. Withdraw your money, deposit it to a less meddlesome bank, and carry on. Money itself, for the time being, is indifferent to who is holding it on behalf of whom, where it came from, where it's going.</p> <p>For money to be neutral<sup><a href='#fn79' id='fnref79' epub:type='noteref'>79</a></sup> requires not just fungibility – the property that ensures any given dollar has the same value as any other – but neutrality in terms of source and recipient. If a dollar can't be spent by Alice, because Alice isn't allowed to use dollars, the money is not neutral. If it can't be received by Alice, ditto. Money must remain money in any context.</p> <p>The novelist Cormac McCarthy summed it up – summed this whole essay up – better than I could:</p> <blockquote> <p>Electronic money. Sooner than you think.</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>There wont be any actual money. Just transactions. and every transaction will be a matter of record. Forever.</p> <p>You dont think people will object to this?</p> <p>They'll get used to it. The government will explain that it will help to defeat crime. Drugs. The sort of large scale international arbitrage that threatens the stability of currencies. You can make up your own list.</p> <p>But anything that you buy or sell will be a matter of record.</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>A stick of gum.</p> <p>Yes. What the government hasnt figured on yet is that this scheme will be followed by the advent of private currencies. And shutting these down will mean the rescinding of certain parts of the Constitution.<sup><a href='#fn80' id='fnref80' epub:type='noteref'>80</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>CBDCs alter the basic properties of money, rendering it shifting, unpredictable, and subject to the will of a single actor: the central bank. Competition among financial service providers no longer provides any hope that your right to transact – if you can just pick the right firm to do business with – will be respected.</p> <p>When you use a digital currency issued by a single centralized actor, that actor can constrain your use of money to an arbitrary degree. The Fed becomes PayPal, JPMorgan, and all their competitors. There is ultimately just one financial services provider, and there's no such thing as withdrawing cash.</p> <p>Of course in all likelihood the financial services industry will continue to exist. Business interests with that much power and money don't tend to simply disappear. But whatever firms you decide to patronize, there will be one ultimate arbiter of how and whether you get to use your money. In principle, even big banks could be subject to summary removal from the system – though they'll be far less vulnerable than any given individual.</p> <h4>CBDCs versus cryptocurrency</h4> <p>Those unfamiliar with CBDCs and cryptocurrency – or familiar with one but not the other – are likely to be confused about the distinction. I don't blame them: not only are these topics niche and complex, they're routinely distorted and misrepresented by ostensibly expert commentators, either through ignorance or dishonesty. (I'll return to the treatment CDBCs and crypto receive in the press later.)</p> <p>For the moment, let's imagine a scenario:</p> <p>'The European Central Bank is considering a digital currency,' a curious, intelligent, broadly informed person with no particular interest in crypto or monetary policy – let's call him Bob – might read in the news. <em>Alright, interesting</em>, Bob thinks, and goes about his day.</p> <p>A week passes. 'Crypto is digital currency,' his brother-in-law who only talks about crypto tells him.</p> <p>'Interesting,' Bob says. 'I read an article the other day about Europe adopting a digital currency. Does that mean they're going to adopt crypto?'</p> <p>'No,' the brother-in-law says, his knuckles visibly whitening around his beer bottle. 'Those are completely different things<em>.</em>' If the central bankers were within earshot, they'd say the same<em>.</em></p> <p>Not only are they different, the central bankers would add, but crypto is downright bad. Here's the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) 2021 Annual Economic Report, which I'll refer to again later:</p> <blockquote> <p>'By now, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are speculative assets rather than money, and in many cases are used to facilitate money laundering, ransomware attacks and other financial crimes. Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint.'<sup><a href='#fn81' id='fnref81' epub:type='noteref'>81</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>In 2023, the BIS followed up with a report on the 'inherent structural flaws' of crypto and recommended a program of '<em>containment</em>, <em>regulation</em> and <em>bans</em>' (emphasis in the original). Central bankers do not like crypto.</p> <p>(The BIS did acknowledge that crypto had introduced a couple of intriguing innovations, but suggested these could best be harnessed via CBDCs.<sup><a href='#fn82' id='fnref82' epub:type='noteref'>82</a></sup>)<br /> <br /> The weird brother-in-law will agree that crypto and CBDCs are completely different things, but he'll argue that CBDCs are the evil twin. 'Crypto is freedom, liberation, self-sovereignty,' he'll say. 'CBDCs are totalitarianism, panopticon, slavery. Big Brother, tyranny, social credit scores!' Give him enough time, and he'll repeat all the arguments in this essay. (It's me, I'm the brother-in-law.) </p> <p><em>Interesting</em>, Bob thinks. <em>There are two kinds of digital currency. They're different. One or the other is bad. Maybe both are. But what </em>is<em> the difference?</em> Then he'll look down at his phone. A notification from Venmo: a friend has sent him $30 for 'drinks [beer emoji]'. Isn't that<em> </em>digital money too? Bob doesn't ask. He doesn't anticipate his brother-in-law's answer doing much to clear things up.</p> <p>I'll discuss cryptocurrencies and their contrasts to CBDCs in more depth later on, but briefly: there are three forms of digital money out in the world (or soon to enter it). The first includes Venmo, PayPal, Zelle and your bank's mobile app. This is simply the legacy banking system, with new interfaces bolted on top of it. Most of the money in the world, it's no secret, is already digital, in that states are not minting coins and printing bills to account for every unit of currency in existence. Banks use computers now, as we all do.</p> <p>Their computers run code written in the 1970s in the programming-language equivalent of Assyrian cuneiform, and somewhere in the system's deepest recesses, I have no doubt, there are still paper forms being pushed around. But no need to stare into that abyss: the first form of digital money is the one you're already familiar with. It's what we refer to, day to day, as 'money.'</p> <p>The second form is cryptocurrency. The first cryptocurrency to be invented was bitcoin, in 2009, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin has since spawned many iterations, imitators, competitors (your choice of word indicates much about your loyalty to one or another crypto tribe, but isn't of much interest to us here). Prominent among these is ethereum.</p> <p>Where bitcoin is a bit like a dollar – you can hold it, you can send it to someone, someone can send it to you, and that's it<sup><a href='#fn83' id='fnref83' epub:type='noteref'>83</a></sup> – ethereum is more of a computing platform. In addition to a basic token (called ether) that can be held and sent around and not much else,<sup><a href='#fn84' id='fnref84' epub:type='noteref'>84</a></sup> ethereum enables the creation of arbitrarily complex applications, which can make use of ether or other, newly created tokens. The most popular applications so far have centered on finance – borrowing, lending, trading – and digital art collection (also financing digital art collection). These applications function using 'smart contracts,' bits of code deployed to the network the way a company might deploy code to its server.<sup><a href='#fn85' id='fnref85' epub:type='noteref'>85</a></sup> </p> <p>No need to proceed too far down that rabbit hole now. What's important to know about cryptocurrencies, in this context, is that they're decentralized. Another way of saying this: they operate without intermediaries. A few other ways: they are self-sovereign, self-custodied, non-confiscatable, censorship-resistant, bearer assets. Until 2009, no such technology existed in the world; it was a pipe dream shared by maybe a few dozen cryptography nerds, so if the concept doesn't immediately click, don't worry. It is in fact a new thing.</p> <p>Practically, what all these words mean is that if you hold crypto, no one can take it from you. No bank, tax authority, court, law enforcement body or anything of the sort can simply seize it. (That is, it's 'non-confiscatable.') No one can keep you from using it, either. You can send it anywhere you want, or do whatever transaction with it you like, within the capabilities of whatever application you're using. No one can freeze your funds (which is what 'censorship-resistant' means).</p> <p>No one needs anyone's blessing to do anything, and no one can be expelled (which is what 'permissionless' means). There is no one in the network with any coercive authority at all (which is what 'decentralized,' or if you prefer, 'self-sovereign,' means).</p> <p>Most people, when they first hear a version of this description, don't really believe it. It doesn't sound like a technology that could actually exist. I'll provide what I believe to be ample evidence that crypto fulfills this promise later on, but let me briefly address one objection: can't someone hack you, kidnap you, or imprison you, and take your funds that way?</p> <p>Yes. The 'non-confiscatable, censorship-resistant' claim is true if you accept crypto's rather narrow definition of possession. <em>Your funds</em> are funds to which you hold the cryptographic private key (which is what 'self-custody' means). If the FBI has hacked your computer and stolen your key, they're not <em>your funds</em> anymore, according to the protocol; they're the FBI's (this is what a 'bearer asset' means). Same if you've been intimidated by threats of physical harm or jail time into handing it over. But if, in the face of these threats, you manage to keep control of your private key, no power under heaven can move your funds without your approval.</p> <p>The third form of digital money, which remains more theory than practice, is a central bank digital currency. Below I'll discuss what these things are – and are likely to become – at length. For the moment, let me just contrast them to cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Where cryptocurrency is decentralized, CBDCs are entirely centralized – more so than the financial system as it currently exists. You may not use a CBDC without the central bank's permission. This will no doubt be widely, almost universally granted, but if the relevant government has placed you on a sanctions list, say, there is a central authority controlling the CBDC that will deny you access to it. This central authority can also determine under what circumstances the currency can be spent, how much of it can be held, what taxes or subsidies apply to it – in short, all the rules.</p> <p>More importantly, the central authority (this could be the central bank itself, some other part of the government to which it's subordinate, or even, in principle, a private company) can change the rules. The rules of cryptocurrency protocols do occasionally change, but only when the whole decentralized, permissionless network of validators decides to adopt the new version of the software. No one can force you to adopt the change. If it's backwards-compatible, you can continue to participate in the network without it. Otherwise, you and whoever else shares your view can 'fork' off into a new network to pursue your own trajectory. The rules of a CBDC can change by fiat from on high, instantaneously and in principle without notice.</p> <p>A central authority controls every aspect of a CBDC. No central authority exists in a cryptocurrency network.</p> <h4>CBDCs today</h4> <p>Enough about what a CBDC isn't. What <em>is </em>it? How does a central bank digital currency work?</p> <p>Empirically, the question has no satisfying answer. At the time of writing, the only retail (that is, consumer-facing) CBDC that's live, deployed and in operation across an entire economy is the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, rolled out in 2021. As of May 2022, this CBDC accounted for 0.1% of the Bahamian dollars in circulation, according to the IMF, and that in an economy that's a quarter the size of the smallest U.S. state's.<sup><a href='#fn86' id='fnref86' epub:type='noteref'>86</a></sup></p> <p>The design choices behind the Sand Dollar provide some of the only available insight into the sort of technology a real-world central bank might choose to build and launch, but there is plenty of time for that design to change, and in any case, the current design has so far seen practically no adoption. So if our goal is to paint a realistic picture of what a mature, widely adopted CBDC might look like in a major economy, the Bahamas' digital currency can only tell us so much.<sup><a href='#fn87' id='fnref87' epub:type='noteref'>87</a></sup></p> <p>China – a major economy if there ever was one – is piloting a CBDC, but describing how it works today wouldn't get us very close to the picture we're aiming for either. As with the Sand Dollar, the digital yuan's role remains basically inconsequential. Only around 10% of the population has ever transacted using e-CNY, and its share of the total value transacted in yuan is tiny.<sup><a href='#fn88' id='fnref88' epub:type='noteref'>88</a></sup> China's CBDC is in its earliest stages, and it's likely to change significantly as its role in Chinese society grows.</p> <p>Nor, for the purpose of this essay, am I especially concerned with China's CBDC. If the Bahamas is too small for its CBDC to be a useful case study, China is too authoritarian. The digital yuan will probably enhance the ruling party's surveillance and social control capabilities, but these are already unmatched almost anywhere. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) stranglehold on its citizens' free expression and civil liberties is exactly what I fear a CBDC could confer on ostensibly democratic regimes. So the digital yuan's effect on freedom, as best I can predict, will represent a difference in degree, not in kind.</p> <p>For that reason I'm more focused on the sort of digital currency the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Reserve Bank of India or Bank of England might develop. And what might those look like? It's still hard to say. </p> <p>They might bear substantial resemblance to China's version, or the Bahamas', or neither. Each is likely to debut in its own initial form, then undergo changes along its own trajectory. Defining CBDCs based on guesses about what they'll look like is difficult not just because they barely exist in the wild today, but because the shapes they take are likely to be many and in continual flux.</p> <h4>CBDCs tomorrow</h4> <p>But enough hedging. It's possible to broadly characterize what CBDCs will probably look like, at least in the early years following general adoption.</p> <p>CBDCs will exist primarily if not solely as deposits in accounts provided directly by central banks. They will be denominated in existing fiat currencies, such as the dollar, euro and yen.</p> <p>They will be digital. As noted above, most money today is already digital. A given dollar is more likely to be an artifact of a bank's database than a piece of paper. Notionally, however, the dollar transcends the bank's software systems. It can be withdrawn as a tangible dollar bill, at which point a physical, bearer instrument embodies that dollar. It can then be deposited at a different bank, where it resumes a digital form as a number on your screen (and a corresponding number on your bank's screen). But now it's in a different database, controlled by a different software system.</p> <p>A CBDC, by contrast, will be exclusively digital. A single – no doubt large, complex, sprawling, constantly updated, imperfectly maintained, but still in a basic sense unified – piece of software will define it. A single source of truth will track all balances: namely, the central bank's database.</p> <p>A dollar will no longer be a slippery, shape-shifting thing, now living in PayPal's systems, now in Bank of America's, now as 5% of a $20 bill. In each case, the financial service provider's software system – or the social mores around the use of paper bills – govern the use of that dollar. The law, while influential in all of these scenarios, has no immediate bearing on how this dollar can or cannot be used at any given time. Banks can do illegal things with their digital dollars, just as individuals can do illegal things with their physical ones. The law may step in later to roll things back and mete out punishment, or it may not.</p> <p>The digital dollar will be always and only a creature of the Fed's database, governed by the Fed's software. And the law – or the Fed's interpretation and implementation of it – will have an immediate effect on the way in which currency can be used. For the first time, the state will be able to preempt transactions it deems unacceptable. Today, it can only address such activity retroactively.</p> <p>What about physical cash? In all likelihood it will persist for a while, perhaps a surprisingly long while, at least in countries where people still use it regularly. But ultimately it's incompatible with the goals and design of a CBDC, and will be eliminated. (To be clear, 'eliminated' in a legal sense. Some form of physical currency might well lubricate black markets indefinitely. I don't feel confident predicting one way or the other.)</p> <p>Does all this mean that banks and other financial service providers won't exist? They probably will, albeit in altered forms, but the important thing is that everyone's balance – yours, the bank's, yours deposited at the bank – will ultimately be stored in the central bank's database, and access to that balance will be governed by the central bank's code.<sup><a href='#fn89' id='fnref89' epub:type='noteref'>89</a></sup> As with the elimination of cash, though, the consolidation of all currency into the CBDC orbit will take time and could conceivably fail.</p> <p>What will CBDC software enable the central bank to do with its digital money? In principle, anything. By virtue of being digital, the currency will be programmable. Such programmability can be limited, but I suspect it won't be, so the possibilities are endless. The central bank could disable any or all functionality for a given account, or manipulate that account's balance in any way it pleased.</p> <p>It could do any one of these things in response to arbitrary stimuli: actions taken by the user, the bank, the police, the stock market, the weather, a sybil in a cave – anything that can be translated into a digital message and relayed to the system, which is to say, anything. The only constraints would be law, custom, self-interest and morality, none of which provides strong guarantees when powerful incentives are at work.</p> <p>Earlier on I described the sorts of interventions and manipulations a CBDC might enable, from relatively benign to frankly horrifying. The most innocuous use case is interest payments. Central banks set interest rates. Currently they do so by setting the rate at which banks borrow from each other overnight, which – imprecisely – determines mortgage rates, the interest banks pay on customer deposits, and all other lending rates across an economy. With a CBDC, the bank could pay interest directly into depositors' accounts. It would be able to determine the rates exactly and change them in real time.</p> <p>Another advantage of a CBDC would be the ability to directly enforce measures imposed by the justice system. This possibility is not, as a rule, addressed head-on, but it's heavily implied by most discussions of the subject. A court orders the assets of a terrorist (money launderer, drug dealer, dissident) to be frozen; now, the central bank can do it directly. A court imposes a fine; now, the money can be transferred from offender to injured party directly – no need for wage garnishing, contempt hearings, sending deputies to seize moveable property, or any such hassle.</p> <p>For CBDC proponents, that's generally where the proverbial <em>part you say out loud</em> ends. Few cite the more exotic ends to which CBDCs could be applied, because they tend to make people nervous. Even the tame applications should give us pause, however.</p> <p>Take interest rates: the earliest proponents of CBDCs cited their appeal – long irrelevant, at the time of writing – as an instrument for enforcing negative interest rates.<sup><a href='#fn90' id='fnref90' epub:type='noteref'>90</a></sup> In the deflationary post-2008 environment, several central banks lowered their benchmark interest rates below 0%, what they'd once called the 'zero lower bound.' This proved problematic, as it destroyed the profitability and threatened the stability of banks that 'earned' the negative central bank rate but paid out positive rates to depositors. They had no choice: if they charged depositors for the privilege of lending their money to the bank, these customers would simply withdraw cash, setting off bank runs.</p> <p>But with a CBDC, passing negative rates through to ordinary savers presents no issue: deposits – or rather, balances, since they can't be withdrawn – are held directly at the central bank. But consider what a negative-yielding CBDC actually looks like: your savings being slowly, or not so slowly, eaten away, with nowhere else to put them. The monetary policymakers who subject you to what's in effect taxation didn't have to win elections and so can't be voted out of office. In other words, you don't have representation.</p> <p>Then there are account freezes and straightforward confiscation, which present even stickier problems. If they only resulted from orders made in open court, in accordance with real laws – the kind passed by elected legislators – that would be one thing. But I struggle to believe that CBDCs will be implemented that way. Recent decades have seen countless innovations in statecraft whereby unelected agents of the executive grant themselves new powers with scant reference to law and rare rebuke by the courts:<sup><a href='#fn91' id='fnref91' epub:type='noteref'>91</a></sup> dragnet surveillance, indefinite detention without trial, undeclared war in who-knows-how-many countries,<sup><a href='#fn92' id='fnref92' epub:type='noteref'>92</a></sup> lockdowns, social media censorship, and the whole KYC/AML apparatus. None of these innovations conform to the textbook picture of constitutional democracy and the separation of powers.</p> <p>Expecting a CBDC to break this trend, to be an exception, would be naïve.</p> <p>This is especially unlikely to happen because central banks already exist at the edge of normal government structures. 'Independent' central banking, as this approach is known, has its advantages: politicians have a tendency to demand unsustainable monetary policy giveaways as elections near. For that reason the Federal Reserve, for example, is not simply one more semi-sovereign organ of the imperial presidential bureaucracy: it lies at an even further remove from voters and their representatives.<sup><a href='#fn93' id='fnref93' epub:type='noteref'>93</a></sup> </p> <p>The bank describes itself as 'independent within government': Congress oversees it, but provides no funding; the president appoints its most senior leadership; private banks own its shares (nationally chartered ones are required to) and, through board seats at the systems' constituent regional banks, participate (alongside the presidential appointees) in the election of its other leaders.<sup><a href='#fn94' id='fnref94' epub:type='noteref'>94</a></sup> </p> <p>Other central banks are similarly distant from the normal functioning of their respective governments, though the specifics differ markedly. Insulation from the electorate and their representatives is consciously built into the logic of modern central banks.</p> <p>We should therefore expect CBDCs to resemble PayPal's Terms of Service more than the Bill of Rights. If central bankers' accustomed approach is any guide, the digital money they issue will operate in opaque, unaccountable and arbitrary ways.</p> <p>What might it be like using such an opaque, unaccountable and arbitrary system as your daily means of exchange? Perhaps minor inconveniences and indignities will be the worst of it: the consumer-facing central bank as a sort of monetary DMV.</p> <p>But if we assume that the demons of 20th century totalitarianism are still with us (they are), we should consider what a more malevolent bureaucracy might do with Turing-complete control over the currency and access to all the following personal data:<br /> </p> <ul> <li>real-time physical location</li> <li>internet browsing history</li> <li>social media posts, likes, etc.</li> <li>court records</li> <li>(to state the obvious) financial history</li> <li>video surveillance</li> <li>medical records</li> <li>genomes</li> </ul> <p>The wicked combinations to which such high-resolution data might be put can't help but excite the authoritarian imagination: what is a person who lives in your neighborhood – who looks like you – doing shopping in <em>this</em> neighborhood? Perhaps a 5% penalty should be applied to your purchases in this area to discourage your roaming. This isn't the first time? Perhaps your wallet should be disabled altogether for a while. What was that you tweeted? Perhaps a fine will discourage your rumormongering. You get the picture.</p> <p>As several commentators on the subject of CBDCs have pointed out, they enable a version of China's notorious social credit score, whereby individuals' rights – or privileges, as they've proven to be in practice – fall away when they're caught engaging in behavior the state deems unacceptable: at a certain point, offenders lose even their freedom of movement, since they're unable to use public transport or buy train or plane tickets.<sup><a href='#fn95' id='fnref95' epub:type='noteref'>95</a></sup></p> <p>As is likely to be the case with CBDCs, many of the actions that negatively impact your social credit score are, most reasonable people would agree, bad: committing fraud, racking up unpaid debts, violating traffic laws, harassing fellow passengers on the metro. But the system is arbitrary, so there's no reason to expect that only bad behavior will be punished.</p> <p>And of course, downright admirable behavior – protesting government misconduct – is liable to earn the most severe sanction, so there's no need to focus on the ways in which China's system <em>could </em>go wrong. The sort of totalitarian oppression that, in a constitutional democracy, would represent a violation of basic principles is baked into the CCP's fundamental approach to governing. (The democracies might violate their basic principles routinely, but at least such principles exist.)</p> <p>I've neglected to mention an important use to which CBDCs could be put, one that at least some CBDC advocates see as beneficial: facilitating the distribution of a universal basic income (UBI). Adequately addressing this topic would require its own essay, so I'll assume for the sake of argument that UBI is otherwise harmless. (It isn't.) But it's important to recognize that coupling a CBDC and UBI amounts to offering a financial inducement to accept the constraints and controls imposed by CBDCs. Whatever the merits of UBI, we should refuse the bribe.</p> <h4>In the central bankers' own words</h4> <p>I'll readily admit that the above is heavy on speculation.</p> <p>In an attempt to present a coherent picture of the outcome I consider most likely, I've made little effort to distinguish between what central bankers, in the harsh light of published working papers and public remarks, say about CBDCs, and what I've concluded based on historical precedent, reading between the lines, and acquaintance with the way people tend to respond to incentives.</p> <p>So let me briefly present CBDCs in the central bankers' own words: the way they describe the technology in public.</p> <p>Most major central banks have produced a healthy volume of literature on CBDCs, almost all of it basically the same. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the 'central banks' central bank,' has published some of the most in-depth discussions of CBDC design, and it's the rare item of CBDC literature by any author that doesn't cite BIS work.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the BIS 2021 Annual Economic Report<sup><a href='#fn96' id='fnref96' epub:type='noteref'>96</a></sup> contains the bank's most detailed treatment of the subject, so I'll summarize the relevant chapter below, adding citations from other central bank publications where appropriate.</p> <p>CBDCs, the BIS writes, 'are a form of digital money, denominated in the national unit of account, which is a direct liability of the central bank.' Simple enough. It distinguishes two forms: wholesale CBDCs, which are limited to use by financial institutions; and retail CBDCs, which are what I've been discussing here, a digital replacement for cash.</p> <p>The BIS divides this latter category, retail CBDCs, into two types: 'cashlike' digital currency using 'token-based access,' and an approach using 'account-based access.'</p> <p>The first approach would enable anonymous transactions, hence the comparison to cash. The technological architecture would resemble crypto, in that holding a token<sup><a href='#fn97' id='fnref97' epub:type='noteref'>97</a></sup> representing a dollar or euro would give one the ability to spend that token – period. It doesn't matter how they came by it, or by extension, what they intend to do with it. The BIS dismisses this option, saying it could 'facilitate illegal activity, and is therefore unlikely to serve the public interest.'</p> <p>The bank is more amenable to a system in which everyone's digital currency tokens are associated with an account, and each account is associated with a real-world identity. This identity could draw on 'information from national registries and from other public and private sources, such as education certificates, tax and benefits records, property registries etc.'</p> <p>In a 2020 publication, the ECB wrote that the digital euro could be designed such that 'all payment devices would require users to validate their identities' using – for example – 'information on physical attributes of the intended user (known as biometrics, e.g. fingerprint and iris recognition).'<sup><a href='#fn98' id='fnref98' epub:type='noteref'>98</a></sup></p> <p>The BIS points out that such a system serves 'to establish individual identities online.'<sup><a href='#fn99' id='fnref99' epub:type='noteref'>99</a></sup> In 2021 the ECB, summarizing the results of its experiments in digital euro design, pointed out that a CBDC 'may require the widespread adoption of an e-ID solution.'<sup><a href='#fn100' id='fnref100' epub:type='noteref'>100</a></sup> As the BIS notes, such a system could 'circumvent the need for paper-based documentation.' More important than reducing paperwork, however, is 'the monitoring of illicit activity' as well as 'preventing fraud and bolstering efforts to counter money laundering.'</p> <p>This KYC'd system need not, the BIS insists, necessarily compromise users' privacy: 'personal transaction data could be shielded from commercial parties and even from public authorities.' It urges that 'safeguards' be put in place to protect privacy, and describes some candidates, such as a voucher system for small transactions maintained by a 'separate data registrar.'</p> <p>The ECB experiments mentioned above showed that 'a very high degree of privacy' is attainable but, it seems, undesirable: it 'would require further analysis to verify that the high level of privacy did not violate AML/CFT regulatory requirements.' The bank also notes that 'the experiments were based on the underlying assumption of each citizen only having one digital euro account/wallet.'</p> <p>In its 2022 annual report, the BIS shifts rhetorical tack, saying that CBDCs would in fact be private – but treating KYC and surveillance by the central bank and law enforcement as consistent with 'privacy.' The bank argues that 'central banks have no commercial interest in personal data, and can thus credibly design systems in the public interest.' It then gestures at zero-knowledge proofs (a bit of cryptography that could, for example, attest to a user's KYC status without revealing personal details) and concludes: 'Achieving both goals – of respecting privacy while using real names – can be accomplished by using public key cryptography.'<sup><a href='#fn101' id='fnref101' epub:type='noteref'>101</a></sup></p> <p>Another report, published by the BIS and the World Bank in 2022, points out that 'validation of the KYC status of a payer and payee can be made a pre-condition and enforced by the CBDC system for any transfer over a threshold amount.' Digital currencies would also allow other, unspecified 'regulatory requirements to be programmed into the CBDC design.'<sup><a href='#fn102' id='fnref102' epub:type='noteref'>102</a></sup></p> <p>This is a reference to the potential programmability of CBDCs, something that's often gestured at in the official literature, but usually not elaborated on. The ECB is typical in its treatment of the topic:<br /> </p> <blockquote> <p>'The potential addition of programmability features to a digital euro was also investigated because the provision of additional logical conditions linked to the payment instructions (that could be defined by third parties) could support innovative business processes and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money and control the conditions of its allocation and use.'<sup><a href='#fn103' id='fnref103' epub:type='noteref'>103</a></sup><br /> </p> </blockquote> <p>In a 2020 discussion paper on CBDC design, the Bank of England (BOE) elaborates on the topic, noting that smart contracts, such as those used on ethereum, could enable conditional payments: 'If X happens, then pay Y to Z.' Delivery of goods could trigger an automated transfer to the vendor, for example. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) devices would also be possible: 'when £X is transferred to account Y, switch on device Z.'<sup><a href='#fn104' id='fnref104' epub:type='noteref'>104</a></sup></p> <p>The BOE sounds nervous about introducing an application layer to its CBDC, however. First, security: every hack that has ever occurred on ethereum – excepting theft of individual private keys – has been due to a vulnerability in smart contract code. Second, performance: processing instructions of arbitrary complexity takes time and computing power, and the added benefits of programmability might not outweigh the extra lag experienced by the whole system. The BOE proposes limiting the range of available smart contract instructions – making the platform less than Turing-complete – or hiving smart contracts off into a separate module as potential solutions.</p> <p>In the 2021 BIS report, there follows some discussion of potential technical implementations of a retail CBDC: a popular option is what bankers call 'distributed ledger technology' or DLT, a protocol similar to bitcoin's ledger (also called a <em>blockchain</em>), but with the difference that the parties maintaining the ledger would be 'permissioned': able to validate the network only if invited to do so by the central bank.<sup><a href='#fn105' id='fnref105' epub:type='noteref'>105</a></sup></p> <p>The BIS also addresses 'division of labour between the central bank and the private sector.' In short, the bank argues that it would be overambitious and counter-productive for the central bank to take over the 'user-facing' roles that private companies such as commercial banks currently perform. The authors argue for a 'two-tier system, where the central bank and the private sector each play their respective role.' They acknowledge, however, that if consumers hold accounts directly with the central bank, 'some operational involvement of the central bank is inevitable.'</p> <p>The publication proposes caps on the value depositors can hold directly with the central bank as one way of establishing a division of labor between itself and the private sector. (Speaking of caps, the ECB assures that it 'is possible to introduce limits on balances and transaction amounts regardless of the underlying technology.'<sup><a href='#fn106' id='fnref106' epub:type='noteref'>106</a></sup>)</p> <p>The BIS also floats a system in which the CBDC doesn't track individual transactions, leaving that to commercial banks. It leaves the possibility open, however, for the central bank to maintain a 'full record of CBDC transactions.'</p> <p>Another BIS publication, 'Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features,' prepared in partnership with the Bank of Canada, ECB, BOE, Bank of Japan, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank), Federal Reserve, and Swiss National Bank, is interesting in that its tone is less restrained than that of most of the other literature these same institutions put out on the subject.<sup><a href='#fn107' id='fnref107' epub:type='noteref'>107</a></sup></p> <p>Rather than entertaining the preservation of cashlike anonymity, or pretending to, the authors state flatly: 'Full anonymity is not plausible.' CBDCs must conform to KYC, AML and other regulations, they say, going on to urge 'strong coordination with relevant domestic government agencies (e.g. tax authorities).' (Central bank publications generally don't explicitly reference such close liaisons between the issuers of currency and law enforcement, though they constantly imply it.)</p> <p>'For a CBDC and its system,' they continue, 'payments data will exist, and a key national policy question will be deciding who can access which parts of it and under what circumstances.'</p> <p>The authors go further, addressing the ability of central banks to ''lock' stolen funds or query suspicious transactions.' (Central bankers often gesture towards <em>combating illicit activity</em>, but rarely state the actual mechanisms of control that must be involved.)</p> <p>The report's authors discuss direct stimulus payments to a country's residents, citing precedents set during covid. They mention potential 'helicopter drops' of money during periods of low demand, as well as the ability of CBDCs to bear interest when the economy is healthier. They propose a 'programmable monetary policy,' giving as an example 'transfers with an 'expiry date' or conditional on being spent on certain goods.'</p> <p>Again, this publication is an outlier due to its relatively frank discussion of the concentrated power central banks will wield once CBDCs are introduced: the ability to surveil the whole universe of transactions and freeze assets where they suspect wrongdoing; the ability to control what goods funds may be spent on and to set time limits on funds' availability.</p> <p>Most written materials prepared by central banks for public consumption are more staid: they explore questions such as whether CBDCs should enable cash-like anonymity, weigh the options, and arrive at the predictable result, the one granting them more visibility and control. </p> <p>But they maintain a tone of detached concern for the public welfare. They propose a solution that would tie every economic transaction of any value to a detailed, state-issued identity – tucking this fearsome measure behind the innocuous term 'account-based' CBDC – and then they make sure to stress the importance of 'safeguards.'</p> <p>I should also note – since I've argued that central banks will move to eliminate cash as soon as they feel it's feasible, that a number of publications say the opposite. In 2020, for example, the ECB wrote, 'A digital euro would be introduced alongside cash, it would not replace it.'<sup><a href='#fn108' id='fnref108' epub:type='noteref'>108</a></sup></p> <p>So much for what the bankers say in public. Behind closed doors, they're less shy. As I was writing this section, I found myself growing frustrated with the material available to me. Absent a clear incentive to protect people's privacy and autonomy – which I don't see any evidence of – there is no reason, in my opinion, to expect a large, unaccountable bureaucratic organ like a central bank to care about such protections.</p> <p>This strikes me as common sense: an individual can act nobly, quixotically, irrationally – any way at all – but large organizations act, on net, in accord with their incentives. When it comes to designing digital currencies, central bankers have, on the one hand, a powerful incentive to take up the proverbial crown lying in the gutter and create a tool of immense power – one that few seem inclined to stop them from wielding. On the other hand, they have a flimsy incentive to give up any this power, to voluntarily cede privacy and autonomy to the currency's users, because it would be a nice thing to do.</p> <p>Still, there was little I could point to that central bankers had actually said which would indicate their willingness to create the sort of panopticon that all logic and historical precedent says they will. When describing CBDCs in their own words, central bankers only hinted at the tool's more sinister capabilities and expressed solemn concern at the prospect of violating civil liberties. Strong if vaguely defined defenses would be contrived to prevent such violations, they promised.</p> <p>And then a video surfaced that, at first, I dismissed as a fake. The footage was of a Zoom call, and on screen was Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB.<sup><a href='#fn109' id='fnref109' epub:type='noteref'>109</a></sup> Unseen was a man engaged in what struck me as a malicious parody of I-wasn't-sure-what Eastern European accent. My first impression was that it was a joke: Lagarde's interlocutor in some real Zoom call had been replaced by a character in the mold of Borat.</p> <p>But the man with the accent wasn't joking, exactly, and Lagarde was clearly answering the questions he was asking. Nor was it an AI generation; or if it was, it was the best AI generation I'd seen by miles.<sup><a href='#fn110' id='fnref110' epub:type='noteref'>110</a></sup> The real Christine Lagarde was in fact giving sincere answers to someone she thought was Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but turned out to be a prankster who has talked his way into interviews with multiple public figures.<sup><a href='#fn111' id='fnref111' epub:type='noteref'>111</a></sup></p> <p>And what she was telling him, among other things, was her candid take on the ECB's plans for a digital euro.</p> <p>Mentioning that whether to move forward with a CBDC would be decided in October 2023 (the end of an 'investigation phase' launched in 2021),<sup><a href='#fn112' id='fnref112' epub:type='noteref'>112</a></sup> she said 'I'm personally convinced that we have to move ahead' due to Europe's dependence on 'the supply of gas by a very unfriendly country,' by which she meant Russia.</p> <p>'I don't want Europe to be dependent on an unfriendly country's currency,' Lagarde said. 'For instance, I don't know, you know, the Chinese currency, the Russian currency, the whatever – or dependent on a friendly currency, but which is activated by a private corporate entity like, you know, Facebook or like Google or anybody like that.'<sup><a href='#fn113' id='fnref113' epub:type='noteref'>113</a></sup></p> <p>Fake Zelenskyy asked why some Europeans oppose the introduction of a CBDC. She didn't answer the question, but said that support is strong in Germany and the Netherlands. So Fake Zelenskyy pressed the point: 'the problem is they don't want to be controlled.'</p> <p>Lagarde's response merits quoting at length:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Yeah, but you know what? You know what? Now we have in Europe this threshold above one thousand euros, you cannot pay cash. If you do, you are on the gray market. You take your risk. You get caught, you are fined or you go in jail.<br /> <br /> 'But you know, the digital euro is going to have a limited amount of control. There will be control. You're right. You're completely right. We are considering whether for very small amounts, you know, anything that is around 300, 400 euros, we could have a mechanism where there is zero control.<br /> <br /> 'But that could be dangerous. The terrorist attacks on France back 10 years ago were entirely financed by those very small anonymous credit cards that you can recharge in total anonymity.' </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>In short, Lagarde admitted the obvious: surveillance and censorship of the digital euro is part of the plan. 'Control' is not an unfortunate side effect of the design tradeoffs involved in building a CBDC; it's the point.</p> <p>If the state (or a supranational institution like the ECB) can't intervene arbitrarily in any transaction, however small or otherwise innocuous, Bad People might do Bad Things. Lagarde selects as her boogeymen the perennial favorite: terrorists. She could just as easily have invoked organized crime, Russia (which she did), pedophiles, or billionaires. Every place and time has its own ensemble of criminals and subversives, but the line is always the same: to stop them, we need more power, so you give up your rights.</p> <p>Lagarde's discussion of a 'limited amount of control' is illuminating. Vows to safeguard privacy and civil liberties generally come off as disingenuous and hand-wavy, but Lagarde dismisses the topic in four words: 'that could be dangerous.' She clearly articulates the attitude that central bankers generally try to obfuscate: they would find anything short of total control unacceptable.</p> <p>Augustín Carstens, General Manager of the BIS and former head of Mexico's central bank, expressed a similar sentiment in 2020, speaking on a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He emphasized the 'huge difference' between a CBDC and cash, and celebrated the 'absolute control' CBDCs grant to their administrators, in contrast to cash:</p> <blockquote> <p> 'We tend to establish equivalence with cash, and there is a huge difference there. For example in cash, we don't know for example who's using a $100 bill today, we don't know who's using a 1000 peso bill today. A key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.'<sup><a href='#fn114' id='fnref114' epub:type='noteref'>114</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The context was a discussion of financial stability: what implications would CBDCs have for monetary policy responses to crises? But Carstens' answer focused on the ability to surveil and censor transactions. He went on to point out, 'if an advanced economy issues a CBDC and somebody in a third country wants to use it, it will require the consent of the central bank of the residence of that person. Therefore the degree of control will be far bigger.'</p> <h4>What's left unsaid</h4> <p>As I mentioned, Carstens was speaking on an IMF panel – a virtual one, given the year. While not a central bank, the IMF shares the BIS' transnational policy orbit (the BIS, of course, isn't a central bank either). The fund has demonstrated a keen interest in the development of CBDCs, not infrequently marked at least by enthusiasm for the power such currencies would grant policymakers.</p> <p>In a 2022 publication entitled 'Digital Currencies and Energy Consumption,' the IMF discusses ways in which a digital currency could alleviate climate impacts. It points out that 'programmability features of digital currencies (for example, smart contracts) could support precise policies such as incentivization of climate-friendly behaviors by users and environmental impact accounting.'<sup><a href='#fn115' id='fnref115' epub:type='noteref'>115</a></sup> </p> <p>It doesn't elaborate on this suggestion. The main body of the report ends with that sentence. But the implications are potentially vast: built into the currency itself would be mechanisms that encourage or discourage spending on certain goods and services.</p> <p>What mechanisms? Would tofu carry a slight subsidy, gasoline a slight tax? Would the currency simply be unspendable on certain products? Under what circumstances? Would individuals' carbon footprints be tracked, and if so, what would be done with that information? If you reach your CO<sub>2</sub> ceiling in October, are you allowed to keep buying food and heating your home for the rest of the year?</p> <p>The IMF declines to address the gorey details, but even to mention 'incentivization of climate-friendly behaviors' raises these questions. If an institution is given the ability to program money, it will. Digital currencies will be context-aware, capable of behaving one way under one set of circumstances, another way under another. Money will have eyes and ears. What precisely do central banks intend to do with such capabilities? They want them, so they should explain why.</p> <p>Until they do, we should read between the lines. We should also try to project a few years in the future: if these are the initial conditions present in a newly introduced CBDC, how do predictable trends and plausible events influence its course of development?</p> <p>Say a CBDC is introduced with a cap on individual holdings of $250,000. The stated purpose – perhaps the sincere motivation – is to protect the role of commercial banks in the financial system. But what if, through some unforeseen consequence of introducing CBDCs, getting a private-sector bank account becomes more difficult? For most people, in that case, the central bank currency is the only option, meaning a limit of $250,000 in liquid assets has in effect been imposed for all but a shrinking elite of connected or grandfathered-in bank account holders.</p> <p>As inflation goes to work, the real value of this cap drops: 20 years later, the maximum cash savings permitted to the vast majority of the population is a modest one-year salary. (Letting a crucial system metastasize so drastically isn't all that unusual: consider Social Security.)</p> <p>These aren't the sorts of discussions we get from central banks and the BIS. Despite publishing thousands of pages collectively on the topic in any given year, these institutions re-tread the same small handful of topics. They acknowledge risks – but in the most anodyne, sanitary way possible. We don't get even the briefest glimpse into the totalitarian maw of programmable money fed on infinite personal data; we hear threadbare notes of caution about Privacy. But these are swiftly dismissed as 'not plausible' or 'dangerous': privacy could help terrorists, so it's out of the question.</p> <p>The so-called benefits of CBDCs are likewise abstracted away. <em>Combating illicit activity</em> … <em>promoting sustainable behaviors</em> … Well that sounds nice, but how? Not a word on the details. Any number of deeply undemocratic power-grabs are implied by these proposals, but the institutions decline to elaborate.<br /> <br /> Practically no one with any sort of institutional backing is willing to describe a plausible vision of how retail CBDCs would – practically, from the consumer's perspective – promote these nebulous social goals. </p> <p>The rare exception is Eswar Prasad, former chief of the IMF's China Division and current professor of trade policy at Cornell University. Speaking at a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in June 2023, he volunteered (neither the journalist interviewing him nor any of the audience members prompted him) a description of programmable CBDCs, and warned central banks not to adopt them:</p> <blockquote> <p>'If you think about the benefits of digital money, there are huge potential gains. It's not just about digital forms of physical currency, you can have programmability: you know, units of central bank currency with expiry dates. You could have, as I argue in my book, a potentially better and some people might say a darker world where the government decides that units of central bank money can be used to purchase some things, but not other things that it deems less desirable, let's say ammunition or drugs or pornography or something of the sort, and that is very powerful in terms of the use of a CBDC and I think also extremely dangerous for central banks.<br /> <br /> 'Because ultimately if you have different units of central bank money with different characteristics, or if you use central bank money as a conduit for economic policies in a very targeted way, or more broadly for social policies, that could really affect the integrity of central bank money and the integrity and independence of central banks. So there are wonderful notions of things that can be done with digital money, but again I fear that technology could take us to a better place, but equally has the potential to take us to a pretty dark place.'<sup><a href='#fn116' id='fnref116' epub:type='noteref'>116</a></sup> </p> </blockquote> <h4>Enter the media</h4> <p>Prasad's description of CBDCs got the sort of play on social media that Lagarde's 'control' line and Carstens' 'absolute control' line did: Twitter and Instagram users recoiled at the totalitarian agenda that introduces a police state under the guise of modernizing the payments infrastructure. As they should.<br /> <br /> But the videos were edited to cut Prasad off before he says 'and I think also extremely dangerous' and explains that central banks should not go down this road. They make his comments about 'huge potential gains' seem unqualified. The World Economic Forum label behind his head makes him look like a WEF ghoul praising the monetary panopticon.<br /> <br /> Which is unfortunate, but people misrepresent each other's views on social media all the time. Why is this particular incident relevant to us here? I mention it because the Associated Press saw fit to publish a 'fact check' of these posts, declaring them 'false.'<sup><a href='#fn117' id='fnref117' epub:type='noteref'>117</a></sup> </p> <p> The AP's reasoning is sound enough: Prasad doesn't work for the WEF, he was just speaking at an event. So he isn't a 'WEF agent,' as one post claimed. And portraying him, personally, as 'calling for' the sort of CBDC he describes is unfair.<br /> <br /> But is the basic message of these posts false? Central banks and international policy bodies are contemplating exactly the sort of technology Prasad describes, and if they aren't contemplating it, they should be: they're actively testing and piloting it, so a bit of thought is in order. Proceeding blindly, without considering any consequences, would hardly excuse them. The AP goes on to 'fact check' the idea that the WEF is calling for a 'cashless society,' which it doesn't, except when it does.<sup><a href='#fn118' id='fnref118' epub:type='noteref'>118</a></sup> The AP even invokes the label of 'conspiracy theories,' without quite calling the post it's fact checking an offender.<br /> <br /> Criticizing CBDCs as tools for surveillance and social control, in perhaps the least surprising development of the last couple of years, has been deemed <em>misinformation </em>by the press. The <em>fact checkers</em> have emerged to quibble with CBDC critics over details, <em>debunk</em> any attack on those grounds and, often as not, caution that <em>spreading</em> <em>misinformation</em> on CBDCs is <em>dangerous</em>: what if our policymaking betters decide that they do want to introduce exactly the sort of technology the <em>conspiracy theorists</em> are warning us about? Then there could be opposition – debate, even – and the institutions might have trouble getting their way. Democracy must be protected from public debate and the voters. </p> <p>(It feels superfluous to spell this out, but I'd rather not leave it unsaid: not all that long ago, the press chided institutions for lying to and failing to serve the populace. The Pentagon Papers, Watergate, Snowden. Now they chide the populace for – they allege – lying about and failing to serve institutions.)<br /> <br /> Complaining about the media is no way to spend one's precious days on earth, so I'll let one more example suffice. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who at the time of writing is running for the Republican presidential nomination, is a critic of CBDCs. </p> <p> In April 2023, the New York Times published a piece accusing DeSantis of 'spreading misinformation about central bank digital currency.'<sup><a href='#fn119' id='fnref119' epub:type='noteref'>119</a></sup></p> <p>The authors mentioned two specific instances: an item of legislation DeSantis proposed in order to 'protect Floridians from the Biden administration's weaponization of the financial sector through a central bank digital currency' and DeSantis' allegation, in a speech, that Democrats want to 'impose an E.S.G. [environmental, social and governance] agenda' through CBDCs. According to the article, the latter statement has 'no factual basis.'<br /> <br /> The Times points out that 'there is no plan to issue a digital currency.' True enough: the Fed has not announced a plan to develop or deploy a CBDC. It is conducting pilots, most notably the Boston Fed's Project Hamilton, and Biden signed an executive order in 2022 calling on federal agencies to explore a U.S. CDBD.<sup><a href='#fn120' id='fnref120' epub:type='noteref'>120</a></sup> But compared to its European and Chinese counterparts, the Fed is proceeding slowly with its CBDC program. </p> <p>As for the allegation that Democrats want to impose ESG measures through a CBDC, calling the statement misinformation seems like, well, misinformation. Prominent Democrats including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ohio Senator Brown have expressed support for an American CBDC.<sup><a href='#fn121' id='fnref121' epub:type='noteref'>121</a></sup> Neither, to my knowledge, has directly stated that they'd like a CBDC to enforce ESG priorities, but just about every discussion of the topic touts CBDCs' ability to combat money laundering, tax evasion and crime (sometimes even climate change) – so drawing a link between ESG priorities and CBDCs is perfectly justified.</p> <p>Brown encouraged federal regulators to impose ESG priorities on the private sector as recently as 2022, issuing the following statement on a new climate disclosure rule: 'I applaud the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] for acting to address climate risks to protect workers, investors, and our economy.'<sup><a href='#fn122' id='fnref122' epub:type='noteref'>122</a></sup> Warren, meanwhile, has formed an 'Anti-Crypto Army' to destroy one of the only means of escaping a social policy-oriented centralized digital currency.<sup><a href='#fn123' id='fnref123' epub:type='noteref'>123</a></sup><br /> <br /> And the Biden administration, as detailed above, has mounted a concerted campaign of social media censorship in order to further its social policy goals. Why not censor people's spending as well as their speech? (Hell, Canada's doing it.)<br /> <br /> So what exactly is baseless about DeSantis' claims? He was warning people of a perfectly plausible outcome. To the extent he exaggerated, made the merely plausible sound like fact, he's earned his fact-check. But is it 'misinformation' to characterize CBDCs as potentially disastrous, and to criticize those who express sympathy for the idea? </p> <p>Here's all the Times' article would concede to those skeptical of CBDCs: 'critics have worried about the privacy concerns of a centralized digital dollar.' No elaboration.<sup><a href='#fn124' id='fnref124' epub:type='noteref'>124</a></sup></p> <p>The real problem with DeSantis' stance, the article suggests, is that 'a lack of popular support could curb the Fed's room to maneuver: If the government decided that pursuing a digital currency was a good idea, for instance, the backlash could make it more difficult to do so.'<br /> <br /> Which is to say, we owe it to the bureaucracy to let it pursue whatever policies it likes. Scrutiny is dangerous and, frankly, presumptuous.<br /> <br /> In other words, central bank digital currencies aren't happening, and it's a good thing that they are. </p> <p>(I said I'd only do one example, but I can't resist sharing the zinger at the end of Paul Krugman's Times op-ed, also in response DeSantis' statements about CDBCs: 'But hey, I guess thinking that money laundering and extortion are bad things is just another example of the wokeness that DeSantis is trying to kill.'<sup><a href='#fn125' id='fnref125' epub:type='noteref'>125</a></sup>)</p> <h4>Code speaks louder than words</h4> <p>As I thought I was putting the finishing touches on this essay, I came across a Github repository for a Brazilian CBDC pilot.<sup><a href='#fn126' id='fnref126' epub:type='noteref'>126</a></sup> It confirmed that the designers of CBDCs, at least at the Central Bank of Brazil (Bacen), are experimenting with exactly the sort of perpetually surveilled, freezable, seizable currency I've described above.<br /> <br /> Frankly all that reading between the lines of central bank white papers – even the candid interview with Lagarde – seems superfluous now. I've left the foregoing exegesis in place, because it's useful to establish that Bacen is not some isolated rogue actor, but carrying out a vision shared to some degree by basically every central bank. It's also useful to sample a range of thinking around the topic of CBDCs, because I suspect that Bacen's 'Digital Real pilot' (the name given in the repo's readme) may not represent the technical direction that other central banks – perhaps even Brazil's – ultimately pursue.<br /> <br /> Still, for what I believe is the first time, a major economy's central bank has made the code for a CBDC publicly available. And code speaks louder than words. </p> <p>Admittedly, we don't have the code exactly. The repo doesn't contain the smart contracts themselves, but technical documentation and specifications describing them. Most interesting are the application binary interfaces (ABIs), files that detail the precise arguments and outputs of each function in their respective smart contracts. These files are automatically generated based on valid code, so the ABIs' existence implies that the smart contracts have been planned in detail and perhaps – though there's no way of knowing – substantially completed.</p> <p>While the names of the functions themselves are clear enough, Bacen provides documentation describing their uses (the function names are in English in the original; the descriptions are translated from Portuguese):</p> <blockquote> <p><code>disableAccount</code>: 'Disables the wallet.'</p> <p><code>verifyAccount</code>: 'Checks if the wallet can receive the token.'</p> <p><code>increaseFrozenBalance</code>: 'Function to increment partially locked tokens of a wallet. Only those who possess.'</p> <p><code>move</code>: 'Function to move tokens from one wallet to another. Only those who possess MOVER_ROLE can execute.'</p> <p><code>pause</code>: 'Function to pause the token in necessary cases, blocking it for all operations.'</p> </blockquote> <p> In plain language, these contracts encode the ability for the central bank (or whoever it grants the permissions associated with <code>FREEZER_ROLE</code>, <code>MOVER_ROLE</code>, etc.) to disable certain people's access to the national currency; to freeze some or all of their funds; to confiscate their funds (to summarily 'move' them out of one account into another); and – I'll admit I didn't see this one coming – to turn off the entire currency, for everyone everywhere, by flipping a single switch. </p> <p>(To be clear, the contract also includes functions to reverse these operations: <code>enableAccount</code>, <code>decreaseFrozenBalance</code> and <code>unpause</code>; <code>move</code>, called with different arguments, can reverse a prior call to <code>move</code>.) </p> <p>The repo doesn't reveal what platform these contracts would be deployed on. It almost certainly wouldn't be public ethereum, which would be too slow and expensive to host a CBDC. Likely the central bank would deploy its own blockchain replicating ethereum's smart contract execution environment (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM), but eschewing features and design that aren't necessary for its use case.</p> <p>On ethereum, all transactions are completely public. Presumably the bank would change that: the public ledger is a measure to enable decentralization, which isn't necessary when a single institution controls the network. But unless they were to adopt a radically private version of the EVM – such things do exist, though 'zero-knowledge' or zkEVMs are bleeding-edge and far from tested at the time of writing – the state will have a complete, transparent ledger of every single transaction anyone performs. The Digital Real will be perfectly surveilled.</p> <p>I'd also like to elaborate a bit on one of these functions, move, since I think it illustrates the sort of power CBDCs confer on their issuers. According to the ABI and documentation, here's what the function does: a user with MOVER_ROLE permissions calls the function with three arguments: from (the user whose funds are being moved), to (the user who will receive the funds), and amount (how much money is being moved).</p> <p>Since I don't have access to the smart contract code itself, assuming it exists, I can't say exactly how the function is implemented, but logically, the contract will check that from holds funds equaling or exceeding amount.<sup><a href='#fn127' id='fnref127' epub:type='noteref'>127</a></sup> It will probably check that to is a 'verified' account, capable of receiving funds. And logically, we can expect that the MOVER_ROLE user calling the function will work at the central bank or elsewhere in the government.</p> <p>What we shouldn't expect is for the function to check that the funds are being confiscated lawfully – in response to a court order, for example. We certainly shouldn't expect that from will need to consent to the operation. The former is difficult to encode in a smart contract (though perhaps not impossible). If the latter were the case, there would be no need for the move function.</p> <p>If something like the Digital Real pilot were to go live, Brazilians would be granting their central bank the ability to instantaneously freeze and seize their funds at any time; to disable their ability to use the national currency; even to disable the national currency entirely.</p> <p>That's far more power than any institution has ever had over any nation's economic life, so the question is: how strong are the legal and institutional constraints available for keeping these newly made demigods in check?<sup><a href='#fn128' id='fnref128' epub:type='noteref'>128</a></sup></p> <h4>Whose programmability?</h4> <p>I should also address something that's crucial to understanding the gulf between what central bankers say about CBDCs, and what they leave unsaid – but imply every time they discuss the topic.</p> <p>Central bankers use the term 'programmability' in two distinct ways, often within the same sentence. Take this one about potential 'programmability features' from the ECB, already cited above: 'the provision of additional logical conditions linked to the payment instructions (that could be defined by third parties) could support innovative business processes and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money.'<sup><a href='#fn129' id='fnref129' epub:type='noteref'>129</a></sup></p> <p>The first part of the sentence refers to the application layer. This sort of programmability – a better word might be <em>composability</em> – would give third parties the ability to build applications on top of the base layer by deploying smart contracts, as developers do on ethereum.</p> <p>Of course permission to deploy such applications would not be completely open, as it is on ethereum (I haven't seen this stated directly, but it seems obvious). Smart contracts could only be written by developers the central bank trusts. A rough parallel, for those less familiar with crypto, would be third-party developers building apps for the iPhone: a vetted, but possibly quite large, community of outsiders writing code that sits on top of the core operating system.</p> <p>Using such smart contracts, a city could integrate public transportation turnstiles with its country's CBDC wallet. The cashier at the café could use a device integrated with the CBDC wallet via smart contracts. Same with the phone you tap against these devices. A big e-commerce company could wire its system up with the CBDC via smart contracts so that when an employee scans a returned item, a refund is automatically sent to the customer's wallet.</p> <p>I don't see anything wrong with this. There are risks – hacks, hits to system performance from needing to support too much arbitrary logic – but the central banks understand them. They can probably overcome them. And anyway, giving people a platform to build on is good: it encourages growth and promotes efficiency.</p> <p>But the central banks perform a clever bait-and-switch in these discussions. They define <em>programmability (noun) </em>as the above: building on the application layer. They make it sound smart and innovative, because it probably is. But then they make references to the capabilities of a CBDC – 'and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money' – which imply a second sort of programmability they don't distinguish explicitly. </p> <p>This second sort is built into the base layer, and can only be augmented or altered by the central bank's own developers: not apps, to return to the earlier analogy, but the iPhone operating system itself, which is only programmable if you work at Apple. This is the sort of programmability I refer to elsewhere in this essay: the ability of the central bank to work whatever logic they like into the joints and marrow of the currency.</p> <p>When central bankers propose building KYC/AML checks into the transaction logic of a CBDC, this is base-layer programmability. Interest rates (positive or negative), caps on holdings, taxes, subsidies, limits on spending, removal from the system – all of this would be possible not because outside developers could deploy applications on top of a CBDC, but because central banks could build such logic into its core.</p> <p>Smart contract 'programmability' is marketing and, in isolation, would probably improve the world. Base-layer programmability lends the state dangerous, unprecedented power.</p> <p>Naturally, there's an annoying caveat to this clean division. It's entirely possible to build a CBDC using the application layer. The Brazilian proof of concept I mentioned above is an example. First, deploy an ethereum-like chain, a base layer that isn't decentralized like ethereum, but isn't extensively modified to perform KYC checks either. Next, encode a CBDC (allowing for summary freezes and confiscations, if you want, go wild) into a smart contract.</p> <p>In this case, the <em>base-layer</em> programmability I described above doesn't actually occur on the base layer. That said, as far as users and outside developers are concerned, it might as well. To use the chain, you have to interact with that smart contract. The CBDC contract isn't one of several options available to you, but in all likelihood, the only user-facing application on the chain. Only the government can manipulate and configure it. The <em>real</em> application layer, if any, sits on top of that contract.</p> <p>I can see why people experimenting with CBDCs build this way. It's easy to build on the application layer; that's why it exists. Let's say we want to check a user's social credit score every time they try to spend money. If their score is less than, say, 65, the transfer fails:</p> <pre> function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) { address from = msg.sender; if ( minimumSocialCreditScore > socialCreditScores[from] ) { revert SenderSocialCreditScoreTooLow( socialCreditScores[from], minimumSocialCreditScore ); } // ... return ERC20.transfer(to, amount); } </pre> <p>For the full contract, see the appendix. All in, building it took a couple of hours. Having worked on smart contracts for ERC20 tokens before, I knew pretty much exactly what I'd be writing before I started. There are thousands of developers who could say the same.</p> <p>Building similar functionality into the base layer of a digital currency would take I'm-not-sure-how-long, because I wouldn't know where to start. While I'm confident I and any number of other people could figure it out, the pool of developers who can jump straight into that kind of task – and avoid I'm-not-sure-what pitfalls – is much smaller.</p> <p>Would a smart contract CBDC provide a satisfactory technical solution for daily use by tens or hundreds of millions of people? I can't say. What I can say is that when central banks mention smart contracts, they want you to think of whizzy IoT integrations, not automated freezes and confiscations.</p> <h4>Who elected you?</h4> <p>It may be that central bankers' public statements are honest and transparent: they wish to combat money laundering, tax evasion and other crimes (not that these other crimes are ever specified). In other words, the boogeymen, and only the boogeymen, will be affected by CBDCs' less-pleasant capabilities.</p> <p>And in all honesty, who would complain if ISIS saw its funding disrupted, or cartel bosses had trouble buying sports cars, or the offshore bankers who cater to such clients felt a bit of a pinch? No collateral damage, just bad people earning their just desserts? Sure, why not.</p> <p>Even if that were somehow the case, though, in what world is a central bank an appropriate institution to play this role? Central banks aren't law enforcement agencies. If they're to become law enforcement agencies, what exactly is their jurisdiction? Surely CBDCs can't be tasked with shutting down any and all illegal activity, so which crimes exactly will they address themselves to?</p> <p>And how, more importantly, will this new police force be held democratically accountable? At a minimum, the statutes granting central banks remit over monetary policy must be revised to enumerate their new responsibilities. And then the entire relationship of central banks to the electorate will have to change. In their current dispensation, central banks are consciously designed to be minimally beholden to elected officials. It proved too tempting for politicians to instruct central bankers to juice the economy going into election season, so the principle of central bank 'independence' is currently the norm in the democracies.</p> <p>But a law enforcement body cannot be 'independent' of lawmakers. If it is, they are no longer the actual lawmakers: they're democratic furniture decorating the waiting room, while behind closed doors people hired for their grasp of macroeconomics decree laws, enforce them, and sentence those who break them, all in one go.</p> <p>Such a system would mark a fundamental departure from constitutional democracy even if the macroeconomists were perfectly wise and benign rulers. (They won't be.) If we are going to abandon democracy for technocratic oligarchy, we need to have a rather serious discussion about that decision, not sleepwalk into it.</p> <p>Then again, why should we assume they'd be benign, or even competent? Positions of unaccountable power attract people who like wielding unaccountable power. A few years into the introduction of CBDCs, central banks will be staffed by those who want to shape their fellow citizens' behavior in highly intimate ways. They will be ambitious and probably brutal in ways few central bank functionaries are today.</p> <p>The last people who should have full visibility into and control over every transaction are the people who want those things.</p> <h3>High modernism, legibility and control</h3> <p>Speaking of such people, to close this chapter, I'd like to explore the mindset I believe motivates the introduction of CBDCs: the worldview I think will shape their trajectory and, with them, the rest of society's.</p> <p>It's hard not to notice that in much of the foregoing, the individuals and institutions I've been casting as villains have often been associated with the political left. To the extent the left's ideas justify or encourage attacks on the freedom to transact, I have no problem criticizing them on straightforwardly political grounds. Feigning partisan neutrality might make the message of this essay slightly more palatable to a slightly wider slice of the political spectrum, but if that comes at the price of honesty or coherence, I'd rather state the obvious: as I write, left-of-center politicians, business leaders, activists and journalists deserve the bulk of the blame for eroding financial freedoms.</p> <p>That said, much of the legal, institutional and rhetorical groundwork for the rapidly worsening status quo was laid – a mere 20 years ago – by the political right. In the aftermath of 9/11, using terrorist financing as justification, the Bush administration and its allies ratcheted up state surveillance of and interference in the banking system.</p> <p>The KYC/AML infrastructure we live with today owes its existence to a muscular, decidedly right-of-center War on Terror agenda, which included not just financial regulations, but dragnet domestic spying by the NSA; the use of a parallel secret court system to rubber-stamp said spying; and a shocking appetite for indefinite detention without trial, torture and assassination.</p> <p>In that era, the left quite correctly accused the right of violating the letter and spirit of constitutional law. Today the roles are reversed. They'll reverse again in the coming decades, probably more than once.</p> <p>Personally, I see little reason to credit either side with a genuine concern for liberal democratic principles (at least, one that survives more than a couple years in power). I regard the freedom to transact as one more safeguard against whichever side is in the more authoritarian mood today – better yet, against both sides.</p> <p>But bothsidesism is a slender reed, and I don't intend to lean on it. In truth there is an identifiable strain of thought impelling opposition to the freedom to transact. This ideological tribe doesn't cluster reliably in any one region of the left-right spectrum, but it exists, and I'd argue it's at least as coherent and real a faction as those shapeless chimeras <em>the left</em> and <em>the right</em>.</p> <p>This ideology was best described by James C. Scott, who called it 'high modernism.' Here's how he defined the term:</p> <blockquote> <p>'a strong (one might even say muscle-bound) version of the beliefs in scientific and technical progress that were associated with industrialization in Western Europe and in North America from roughly 1830 until World War I. At its center was a supreme self-confidence about continued linear progress, the development of scientific and technical knowledge, the expansion of production, the rational design of social order, the growing satisfaction of human needs, and, not least, an increasing control over nature (including human nature) commensurate with scientific understanding of natural laws.'<sup><a href='#fn130' id='fnref130' epub:type='noteref'>130</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This definition is fine as far as such an abstract description goes, but high modernism is best understood in concrete terms, since there's nothing the high-modernists of the 20th century loved so much as pouring concrete. We can grasp the high-modernist mentality by picturing their favorite project: the planned, rational city.</p> <p>The high-modernist city is large. It is laid out along a rectangular grid, permitting only one non-rectilineal flourish: the huge clover-leaf curves where its mighty 10-lane highways intersect. Its architecture is monumental but unadorned: enormous squares, wide boulevards, imposing brutalist headquarters for ministries and firms (preferably state-owned).</p> <p>Function dictates all spatial division: the city has a district – one – for sleeping (in gargantuan, undifferentiated apartment blocks); a district – one – for office work (drafting grand plans to make society anew); a district – one – for manufacturing (assembly-line factories whose efficiency would dazzle Henry Ford); and a district – one – for leisure (rigorous calisthenics in groups of several hundred, dressed in matching tracksuits, arrayed in a perfect grid).</p> <p>The city should be built from scratch on flat, featureless, virgin land. Failing that, the existing city must be utterly bulldozed and replaced. The high-modernist city makes no accommodations for cultural, geographic or historical accident: it would look the same if it were built in Russia, France, Brazil or India. There being only one rational solution to the problem of how to construct a human city, the setting is unimportant. Any nod to local aesthetic tradition is a misguided concession to parochialism, to semi-feudal darkness. Only the flag flying from the ministries' roofs should concede the existence of human diversity or local history. (And this a reluctant concession.)</p> <p>The high-modernist city shall countenance no ancient quarter, bohemian district, historic center, ethnic enclave, ghetto or bazaar. No winding alleys; no unnamed, nicknamed or unsigned streets. Nothing a highly educated and credentialed servant of the state would decline to include in their blueprint for a freshly built city. That this servant of the state draws up their plans in an office thousands of miles away from the site and employs only the Principles of Municipal Design – remaining perfectly ignorant of the place and its inhabitants as they currently exist – is not an absurdity, but virtuous, modern and scientific.</p> <p>The inhabitants of the city shall all speak the national language (absent a global language). They shall all have first and last names – the ones they were born with and will keep unchanged throughout their lives (antiquated marriage customs permitting). They shall carry standardized identification cards that bear these names, a permanent address (moving is rare and more than a bit suspect) and a serial number uniquely identifying them.</p> <p>They shall learn reading, writing, state-sanctioned history and arithmetic in state-run schools with standardized curricula, their progress measured on standardized tests administered by standardized bureaucrats. They shall work year-round, salaried jobs, for which they're paid on time in the national currency. Their paychecks, with the proper (hefty) taxes withheld, shall be deposited to regulated (better yet, state-owned) banks.</p> <p>The people are uniform. They are interchangeable. They are 'the masses.'</p> <p>When the masses need something (let's not get hung up on wants), they purchase it from a store, whose owner faithfully reports every transaction so that it can be properly taxed. The store holds all necessary licenses from all relevant regulators, whose agents conduct frequent, thorough inspections.</p> <p>The masses do not bribe, barter, gamble, steal, trade on the side, or underreport their tips. They keep their vehicle registrations current. They are strangers to traffic jams, bustling street corners, potholes, graffiti, loud music – to waste, frivolity, stupidity and noncompliance in all its forms.</p> <p>The food they eat comes (via unclogged highways and timely trains) from large, efficient farms employing fertilizers and pesticides produced in the Manufacturing District, seeds optimized by scientists for maximum yield, and workers trained to perform discrete tasks with machine-like efficiency – aided, of course, by shiny machines.</p> <p>There are no peasants on these farms: no one lacking surnames, schooling, papers. No households farming three or four discontinuous strips of land scattered around the village, to which they've been assigned a convoluted form of usufruct by some musty huddle of elders. No household gardens growing jumbles of herbs, no hoards of grain hidden in the rafters or basement. No weird ancient privileges, written down nowhere except perhaps a Latin parchment in the church (which no one can read). No obstacles to the universal application of law and taxation. No manure.</p> <p>High modernism is right angles, the metric system, order, simplicity, standardization. At least, that's the aesthetic its acolytes value. And they sincerely believe that, if this aesthetic is imposed and the dark tangle of tradition and superstition is banished, progress and human flourishing will inevitably result.</p> <p>To no small degree, they have been right. The West and much of the world beyond lives in a version of this dream, and few would turn back the clock.<sup><a href='#fn131' id='fnref131' epub:type='noteref'>131</a></sup> Mass literacy, ample food, clean water, accessible medical care, longer lives and a drastic reduction in day-to-day violence are largely the fruits of such a mindset. But of course, such safety and prosperity are only impressive relative to pre-modern benchmarks. Relative to the only rational benchmark – perfection – modern society has utterly failed its people.</p> <p>Here we encounter the break between modernism – the approach that's drastically improved life in the more prosperous parts of the globe over the last couple of centuries – and its 'muscle-bound' cousin: <em>high</em> modernism elevates rationality from a means to an end in itself. </p> <p>Where modernism values scientific inquiry, high modernism values only its fruits: internal combustion; disease-resistant crops; skyscrapers; gently whirring, chromium-plated machines. Actual scientific inquiry – the process of experimentation, measurement, analysis, and further experimentation – is banished as so much tedious fumbling in the dark. The mindset is strikingly nonempirical, based on a faith in the salvific power of science as an aesthetic, rather than science as a discipline. All has been revealed by the light of Rationality; no need for further inquiry.</p> <p>Scott gives the example of Brasília, one of the few cities in the world to be planned and constructed from scratch according to these principles. The expert who designed it drew inspiration not from any of Brazil's thrumming cosmopolitan centers – nor for that matter from successful modern cities built on grids, like Chicago – but from a completely abstract conception of what the ideal city should look like.</p> <p>The result, when complete, was a lifeless metropolis that afflicted its relatively few residents with what they call 'brasilitis,' a malaise born of vast stretches of asphalt, hulking concrete towers, and none of the energetic street life that characterizes other Brazilian cities. The population of Brasília's metropolitan area did initially grow quickly due to massive internal migration, but the majority settled in satellite cities that grew up organically around the hollow Modern City in the center. These unplanned places, it seems, proved more amenable to the real requirements of human life (and perhaps more importantly, Brazilian life).</p> <p>Over the decades Brasília has partly shed its reputation for oppressive rationality, but the credit is probably due to the compromises its residents have forced on the design: traffic lights, for example, were regarded as unnecessary in a Scientific road system, but were eventually installed anyway.</p> <p>Brasília provides an elegant example of how high modernism can fail on contact with humanity, but in the end it caused more malaise than real suffering. Other high-modernist projects number among the cruelest endeavors in human history.</p> <p>The Bolsheviks were perhaps the quintessential high-modernists: they did not limit their plans to rationalize human society to a field as constrained as municipal architecture. They intended to sweep away all that came before – all that was backward, bourgeois, feudal, capitalist, superstitious, imperialist – and create a society without religion, family, national identity, money, class or government.</p> <p>A handful of skilled administrators would be sufficient to supervise the great farms and factories that would, of their own proletarian accord, produce ample food and clothing for the masses, this homogenous pink goo that would – freed from the benighted structures of pre-socialist stages of development – forget all the old vanities: history, acquisitiveness, God, and love for spouses, parents and children.</p> <p>Most of this vision was so blinkered that it was never even tried. The briefest attempt was made to interpret the hyperinflation that resulted from war, famine and bureaucratic malpractice as a victory: the successful abolition of money.<sup><a href='#fn132' id='fnref132' epub:type='noteref'>132</a></sup> Exuberant plans for the abolition of the family and its associated living arrangements circulated.</p> <p>But Soviet printing presses continued to churn out currency – a lot of currency, then even more – and Bolshevik grandees moved with their wives and children into government-funded apartments that any Muscovite bourgeois family of the Romanov twilight would have envied.<sup><a href='#fn133' id='fnref133' epub:type='noteref'>133</a></sup></p> <p>Even so, a few of the more brutally disruptive plans to usher in the socialist utopia <em>were</em> carried out – to completion, if not with any success. The best example is collectivization. </p> <p>The modernist, to say nothing of the high-modernist, would regard the Russian peasant village with horror. Scott describes the bewildering variety of farming techniques and legal concepts that existed over Russia's vast territory. This was a problem in itself, but to make matters worse, each permutation was downright medieval. (The middle ages ended late in Russia after all: many peasants were legally classed as serfs into the 1860s). A family would cultivate several scattered strips of land, growing different crops here and there, as well as fishing, chopping wood and harvesting other natural resources. Governance was based on oral tradition, simultaneously vague and intricate, flexible and achingly specific.</p> <p>The collective farms formed the sharpest possible contrast to this situation: vast acres of monoculture, tilled by tractors, subject to quotas calculated by the all-seeing center, managed by professional cadres with a deep understanding of scientific socialism (and none of farming).</p> <p>The problem, among others, was that peasants did not want to be forced onto collective farms, which they saw – reasonably enough – as a a return to serfdom on noble estates, or the extension to the civilian realm of the barracks life many had known in World War I and the Civil War. The regime that had sent armed men (sometimes soldiers, sometimes thugs) to take their harvests throughout the long war years was now appropriating their land, relocating them and taking their harvests. Many peasants killed their livestock rather than turn it over to the regime. </p> <p>The regime, in turn, did what high modernists do and applied Theory to the situation, in this case class theory: it identified (or invented) a stratum of rural bourgeoisie, the <em>kulaks</em>, whom it blamed for all resistance and set about murdering en masse. The result of all these policies was not just a shocking tally of injustices against individuals and communities, but famines that killed millions.</p> <p>Can it really be, though, that the Bolshevik regime would starve its own people in the pursuit of aesthetically modern agriculture? It had proved far more flexible in the face of other realities. In its earliest days, the Soviet Union was governed by young men who had spent their lives in prison, Siberian exile, or abroad, waging bitter pamphlet feuds over the fine theoretical points of their scheme to overhaul the world. They had no experience in government, finance, industry or agriculture, and stood no chance of managing – much less radically overhauling – these sectors. For the most part, they accepted this reality and recruited the old regime's bureaucrats and managers to resume their old roles. But agriculture was the exception. In that sphere, the Bolsheviks pushed ahead with a program that wasn't even central to Marx's thinking.</p> <p>The reason was that the Soviet regime desperately needed to establish control over the peasantry. First, the peasantry represented the vast majority of the population. Second, the Bolsheviks were barely able to feed the cities. In previous years they'd resorted to forced requisitions of grain from the countryside. But repeatedly invading the hostile hinterland was not a sustainable solution. Looked at from this angle, collectivization was not a reform measure, but a brutal and decisive strategy employed in a civil war waged by the urban regime against the peasantry.</p> <p>Collective farms, while they did produce (some) food, were as much concentration camps designed to intern a rebellious population as they were farms.</p> <p>Collectivization was a means of rationalizing the agricultural sector, but not in order to increase crop yields. The goal was to take a scattered, diverse people living according to a welter of local rules – always unwritten and always baroque in their complexity – and subject them to a single system. The <em>kolkhoz</em> (collective farm) standardized the peasants, making them 'legible,' in Scott's term, and therefore controllable. If millions of them died in the process, that was – at least to Stalin's thinking – beside the point.</p> <p>Other authoritarian regimes in the socialist tradition have repeated the same <em>mistakes</em> as Stalin, not because – or not exclusively because – they'd convinced themselves that a systematized, high-modernist approach to agriculture would lead to prosperity, but because they found a complex, scattered, variegated peasantry to be deeply threatening. In China, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and elsewhere, the goal has been to create a uniform, visible populace, onto which order can be enforced and from which resources can be appropriated.</p> <p>How can a government – particularly one based, at least ostensibly, on central planning – know how much food it can expect to produce if, ten miles outside its capital, there are no records of how much land is cultivated, what's grown on it, who's doing the growing, or even who <em>who </em>is? </p> <p>Peasant identity does not map to bureaucratic identity. 'Will' is not a satisfactory persona in the state's eyes, even if he's the only Will in the village, which he won't be. <em>Will, John's son</em> is a step in the right direction (better make that 'William Johnson'), though there's no way of knowing whether he's the same person as Will the tailor ('William Taylor') or short Will ('William Short'), so called for his prodigious height. When was this person born? Where? Where does he live, what is his wife's name, and does he own a horse or mule we can requisition for the spring campaign?</p> <p>Such an unknowable mass is not a reliable producer of food for the factories and army, or for that matter recruiting ground for workers and soldiers. Worse, it's potentially rebellious, since sending soldiers and factory workers (back) to take its harvest seems to enrage it to no end.</p> <p>Western Europe required centuries to impose a measure of bureaucratic order on its peasantry. Since the communists were making the world anew anyway, they felt it would be easier to uproot, relocate and enumerate the whole lot all at once.</p> <p>This approach isn't limited to leftist revolutionaries. Western colonial regimes have imposed many equally violent transitions into modernity. The United States fenced in the nomadic native peoples of the plains, subjected them to censuses, made them cut their hair and learn the national language, and killed the majority of them, directly or by driving them to despair. The apartheid regime carried out a similar program in South Africa. Independent Tanzania's collectivization ('villagization') push drew ideological inspiration from Stalin and Mao, but if one didn't know that, it would be easy to see it as a simple continuation of British colonial policy.</p> <p>Again, for the purposes of this analysis, the urge to assign political valences (left, right, imperialist, revolutionary) to the states carrying out these programs is probably a distraction. Any sufficiently powerful state, confronted with a population it cannot adequately surveil, will undertake shockingly violent measures in order to gain that capacity – in order to make it legible. Even where the government is not a foreign colonizer convinced of its racial superiority, but indigenous, as in China, Russia, Tanzania or Ethiopia, the results are horrific.</p> <p>Returning to our vision of the high-modernist city and its perfectly behaved, quota-exceeding masses: how are the authorities supposed to manifest their rational utopia when the masses refuse to conform to the grid? Real people steal, get drunk, gamble, do drugs, study art history instead of engineering, obtain illegal weapons, then kill each other with them. They bribe officials, refuse to send their kids to approved schools, clump together in neighborhoods with others who refuse to speak the national language. They decline to report earnings, decline to register their vehicles. They join unions and churches and gangs. They refuse vaccines.</p> <p>To control these irrational impulses – to force the fractal, turbulent forces of normal human behavior onto the high-modernist grid – the state must first locate infractions: it must know who is doing what, where and when. And to know such things reliably at scale, it must surveil the entire populace closely.<br /> </p> <p>'An illegible society,' Scott writes, 'is a hindrance to any effective intervention by the state, whether the purpose of that intervention is plunder or public welfare.' In contrast, 'a thoroughly legible society […] creates a kind of national transparency through the uniformity of codes, identities, statistics, regulations, and measures.'<sup><a href='#fn134' id='fnref134' epub:type='noteref'>134</a></sup></p> <p>To illustrate the sinister turn enhanced state capacity through enhanced legibility can take, Scott includes a map of Amsterdam compiled by the municipality in collaboration with the occupying Nazis. It shows in stark detail the distribution of the city's Jewish population in 1941, each of the countless tiny dots representing ten Jewish individuals. Crucially, this data was not compiled exclusively by the Nazis. It drew heavily on the 'exceptionally comprehensive' census data gathered by the pre-invasion government of the Netherlands. The presumably benign motivations behind the original data collection did nothing to constrain the later use of that data by a malignant state.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the right to transact. While at least one high-modernist state of the 20th century briefly contemplated abolishing money, none attempted to track its every movement – how could they? In an analog world, it was no more practical to record every economic exchange than it would be to record every spoken word.<sup><a href='#fn135' id='fnref135' epub:type='noteref'>135</a></sup></p> <p>The authorities would certainly be on the lookout for suspicious exchanges of any kind – of value or sentiment – and their spy networks could be brutally effective in this regard. But to automate the process, to sit by and let passively collected, comprehensive data flow into centralized repositories for analysis? Such wondrous legibility was unthinkable until now. To say nothing of the ability to censor economic exchanges in real time and reverse them by fiat after the fact.</p> <p>The high-modernist states of the 2020s and 2030s will absolutely pursue this means of rendering their populations legible and controllable, if permitted to do so. It will matter very little what sort of rhetoric the politicians at their heads use in justification: nationalist, anti-racist, racist, environmentalist, socialist or theocratic. Any of these, so long as it claims a monopoly on truth, is perfectly compatible with the jealous paranoia of the all-seeing police state.</p> <p>Nor does the initial justification for adopting these capabilities determine – or even constrain – the uses to which they'll later be put. The Dutch constitutional monarchy of the early 20th century was simply doing what any respectable European state of the era would: collecting data on its population. Whatever its motives for learning the address of every Jewish household in Amsterdam, they weren't genocidal. No matter: the Nazis put the data to their own use.</p> <h2>Cryptocurrency protects the right to transact</h2> <p><em>I'm sorry that your warrantless surveillance regime was built on the assumption that people would always need intermediaries to transact.</em></p> <p>Neeraj K. Agrawal</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As I write, cryptocurrency is as popular and as unpopular as it's ever been. A few short years ago, bitcoin – there was nothing to speak of but bitcoin – was the hobby of a vanishingly small niche centered around Mises-reading C programmers. Those who were familiar with it and did not fit the above description knew it as the coin of the Silk Road, a dark web marketplace where every manner of drug and a few even-more-illegal goods and services were on offer.</p> <p>Few normal people, even if they'd admit to having bought MDMA with bitcoin, could tell you how it worked or why it was created. (This is painfully obvious in retrospect, given how many people assured me around that time that bitcoin was 'completely private.') To know about bitcoin, much less to share such knowledge at parties, marked one out as a weirdo: a Mises reader, if not a C programmer. Even so, by late 2013, the price was on a parabolic run, and knowledge of its existence was beginning to move in from the margins.</p> <p>Then the sole bitcoin exchange, MtGox, imploded in a spectacular hack or spectacular fraud, or perhaps both, and the fun was over for a few years.</p> <p>By 2017, bitcoin's inert digital gold had been joined by a Turing-complete blockchain platform, ethereum, where developers could create new digital coins and imbue them with logic of arbitrary complexity. They mostly opted for making extravagant promises based on this exciting prospect and monetizing the paradigm shift in advance – well in advance – through 'initial coin offerings' (ICOs). The vast majority of the ICO tokens went to zero: many issuers were simply scammers, many others were earnest and more or less competent, but ultimately unsuccessful. A few projects from that era have survived and created enormous value for early investors, but none had an easy go of it.</p> <p><em>Crypto</em> – the world beyond, but originating from, bitcoin – was making tentative inroads more or less everywhere. By 2018 few people exposed to mass media had <em>no</em> idea what crypto was. And a not-insignificant portion of the population, in some countries at least, had access to exchanges where they could purchase the assets. The size of the market had achieved thrilling new highs: bitcoin rivaled the market capitalization of major investment banks – briefly.</p> <p>But a deep and not-unjustified suspicion had set in. Internet hucksters had promised to recreate Uber, Google and Facebook, but better, global, <em>decentralized</em> – and what did that mean anyway? They'd taken investment capital (not from VCs, but from hordes of blinkered retail investors), and in many cases simply disappeared with it. Meanwhile a few highly visible, extremely grating internet personalities were flaunting their Lamborghinis, promising that you too could ride the magical infinite money wave to riches. Not to mention the shocking amount of electricity that 'mining' these fake internet coins consumed.</p> <p>It was hard not to hate the whole thing.</p> <p>A couple years after the bubble burst, not just the ICO tokens but bitcoin and ethereum themselves seemed to be headed for zero, until in 2020 and 2021, a confluence of factors set off another crypto mania.</p> <p>First was the creation of decentralized finance ('defi'), a suite of applications of the sort the ICO founders had promised, but mostly failed, to build. A number of these, including a couple class-of-2017 projects, had gone live – and they worked. Users could borrow, lend and trade tokens on-chain, without resorting to centralized exchanges. The second factor was a massive influx of easy money: central banks and governments the world over flooded markets with stimulus and interest-free loans in an attempt to fight off the covid-induced depression many feared.</p> <p>History repeated itself, but this time at another order of magnitude. Crypto wasn't just plastered across tech and finance blogs, but every major outlet. No longer the province of long-forgotten child actors and retired athletes, crypto scams secured the endorsements of the world's sparkliest celebrities. After a year or so the defi money machines faded from focus, but the 'ethereum-killers' (alternative blockchains promising faster or cheaper execution) stepped in, along with non-fungible tokens or NFTs (latter-day ICOs with jpegs attached), which made extravagant promises to build groundbreaking video games and global luxury brands, but mostly nose-dived to zero after an (optional) initial pump.</p> <p>Exchanges reached unheard-of dimensions: one, FTX, bought naming rights to a stadium, Super Bowl ad time, a herd of journalists and not a few politicians – before collapsing as the result of fraud more egregious and megalomaniacal than anything the industry had seen before. Which is saying something.</p> <p>As I write, the late bull market is a recent, painful memory, so I won't go into every grisly detail. Suffice it to say that the most recent crypto boom brought awareness of the phenomenon to give or take every corner of the globe, swelling the sector until it rivaled the largest companies in the world in market capitalization. Crypto is more popular than ever.</p> <p>And yet it is more hated than it's ever been. Critics hate it for the energy wasted, in their view, by bitcoin mining (ethereum, which for most of its history was mined similarly to bitcoin, no longer uses large quantities of electricity, but not everyone knows that). They hate it for being, in their view, a Ponzi scheme, a giant fraud whereby hordes of starry-eyed new entrants pay for earlier entrants' Miami condos. They hate the dog coins. (These are like bitcoin, but with dog names and logos. Now there are also frog coins. Exciting.)</p> <p>They hate the hacks that drain tens of billions of dollars from applications they've never heard of and can't fathom the point of – then used to fund, and this is not a joke, North Korea's nuclear weapons program.<sup><a href='#fn136' id='fnref136' epub:type='noteref'>136</a></sup> They hate the vapid, smug slogans – <em>we're all gonna make it</em> – that vapid, smug people with erstwhile $100,000 NFT profile pictures recite back and forth to each other. And though they'll never admit it, they hate that these people made all that money and not them.</p> <h3>Cryptocurrency works</h3> <p>Fair enough. But I disagree with anyone who concludes that the thick layer of slime crypto accumulates in every bull market (and never completely washes off in the bear markets) defines or invalidates the technology.</p> <p>Bitcoin, ethereum and some others<sup><a href='#fn137' id='fnref137' epub:type='noteref'>137</a></sup> do what they were designed to do, successfully and reliably. If you manage to obtain and properly self-custody these assets, no one can confiscate them from you or stop you from spending or otherwise making use of them within the bounds of the relevant protocol. They are permissionless, censorship-resistant, non-confiscatable assets.</p> <p>A small but dedicated clutch of cryptographers and computer scientists spent decades trying to create these sorts of assets. Decentralized digital cash proved to be a difficult problem. Cryptographic primitives developed in the 20th century allowed for the secure transfer of information, but transferring value was a different story. You can send the same encrypted message twice without degrading or devaluing its contents; at worst, you'll mildly annoy the recipient. But if you're able to send the same $100 twice, then it's not $100, is it? It's more like $0. Any protocol that behaves this way can't serve as money.</p> <p>A piece of paper can't be copied and pasted – that is, not trivially: counterfeiting cash is hard. Digital information can, so translating money into digital information requires a solution to this issue, what's called the 'double-spend' problem.<sup><a href='#fn138' id='fnref138' epub:type='noteref'>138</a></sup> Early attempts at building cryptographically secure money relied on a centralized referee – usually called a 'bank' – that would ensure no participant in the network tried to spend the same money twice. This was hardly satisfactory, though: whoever controls the bank controls the network, so why build such a protocol at all? Why not just keep your money – which certainly by the 21st century was digital anyway – at Bank of America or Chase?</p> <p>Bitcoin solved this problem. The specifics of how it did so are fascinating, to me at least, but would require a long digression into the basics of cryptography that not all readers are likely to find worth their while.</p> <p>Less important than how it works is <em>that</em> it works. More than a decade into the bitcoin experiment, we know that it does: no one has yet been able to confiscate anyone's bitcoin or censor a bitcoin transaction. A multibillion-dollar bug bounty is waiting for someone clever or well-resourced enough to crack it, and no one has managed.</p> <p>In fact, the multibillion-dollar price tag probably understates the incentive for some actors. Major governments and big banks face no challenge to the monetary status quo quite as direct and tenacious as crypto. I'm not sure how one would price the ability to take it off the board – but I imagine it would be in the trillions.</p> <p>And yet no one has. China, a military, technological and economic superpower, is deeply hostile to crypto: it's essentially banned crypto outright<sup><a href='#fn139' id='fnref139' epub:type='noteref'>139</a></sup> – though its long series of crackdowns<sup><a href='#fn140' id='fnref140' epub:type='noteref'>140</a></sup> is itself an indication that the ban is ineffective. If it were able to, wouldn't the government have simply confiscated its citizens' bitcoin, or attacked the protocol itself, rendering the network useless and the asset worthless?</p> <p>I submit that it would have, if it could. Decentralized censorship-resistant money would make even the most libertarian government (whatever that might look like) sweat. But for a state as authoritarian as China, it's anathema.</p> <p>Even if the CCP had forsworn such extreme measures for some reason, or found it in its interest to let the crypto experiment run, some other powerful, motivated actor would have pulled the trigger by now. It's not even necessary to envision mass confiscation or a total crippling of the network: if it were possible to force or block the transfer of bitcoin, a court somewhere would have ordered it done – or rather, been able to enforce such an order. This hasn't happened. No single actor can order the bitcoin network to perform or desist from any action.</p> <p>Of course, it's still possible to threaten a person with incarceration or violence if they don't hand over their bitcoin. No technology yet devised can obviate that attack vector. It's also possible to take someone's assets by obtaining their secret key through whatever means, including ones that can be highly difficult to defend against. To take someone's secret key is to take their crypto; the network doesn't know or care who has the 'right' to a given sum of tokens, it only cares who can sign a transaction with the correct key. </p> <p>For this reason, it's easy to take someone's assets when they're held by a third-party custodian, such as an exchange: from the protocol's perspective, those aren't the customer's assets in any meaningful sense, but the exchange's – indistinguishable from any other assets controlled by the same private keys. So the exchange can abscond with them at any time, as happens not infrequently.</p> <p>But if we accept the radical nature of crypto ownership – that it is a bearer asset, period – we can see that no one has ever stopped someone else's crypto transaction from going through, and no one has ever performed a transaction on someone else's behalf (in other words, confiscated their crypto).</p> <p>How important is this achievement in practice, given that you're still ultimately vulnerable to extortion and threats of physical violence? I'd argue, immensely. Banks can no longer disappear with your savings: there is no need to trust your assets to a custodian. The state can no longer simply order your assets frozen or seized: they will have to actually come and take them, giving you time and room to flee.</p> <p>Americans in particular may scoff at this notion, but they shouldn't: if their own grandparents didn't board a steamship to the New World with only the jewelry they could hide on their person to build a new life with, many other people's grandparents did.</p> <p>And more prosaically, crypto renders impotent all those creeping limitations on people's ability to purchase legal goods and services. The centralized service handling your payment might not let you buy some pornographic media; it might flag your purchase of a firearm; if PayPal had had its way, it might even fine you for saying something it doesn't agree with. None of this is possible with bitcoin. The U.S. government couldn't stop people from paying for controlled substances with bitcoin on the Silk Road: it had to find the people running the service and physically take them into custody.</p> <p>So when governments, commercial banks, central banks and their allies in the media sneer at crypto's claims of decentralization, they are lying to you if not to themselves. Some of their specific critiques are well-founded, if exaggerated, but to the extent they imply that crypto fails at censorship resistance, they're simply false.</p> <p>Occasionally, a government believes its own propaganda, with amusing results. When the Canadian government debanked protesters in response to what it called 'illegal blockades' in 2022,<sup><a href='#fn141' id='fnref141' epub:type='noteref'>141</a></sup> it was surprised to find that bitcoin did in fact do what its proponents claimed. The authorities were able to freeze bank and payment app accounts with a stern word to the relevant businesses. But when they ordered several cryptocurrency wallets to be frozen, they met with mixed success.<sup><a href='#fn142' id='fnref142' epub:type='noteref'>142</a></sup> To the extent the order required exchanges and other centralized businesses to treat these accounts as untouchable, it could be enforced.</p> <p>But to the extent it tried to halt the use of self-custodied crypto, it was a risible failure. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice demanded that several entities freeze crypto addresses and provide information on the owners of these addresses. Among these 'intermediaries,' as the February 15 order called the entities, was at least one non-custodial bitcoin wallet provider, Nunchuk.<sup><a href='#fn143' id='fnref143' epub:type='noteref'>143</a></sup> In an email sent to the court and posted on Twitter, Nunchuk explained why it couldn't comply:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Nunchuk is a self-custodial, collaborative-multisig Bitcoin wallet. We are a software provider, not a financial intermediary.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'Our software is free to use. It allows people to eliminate single points of failures [sic] and store bitcoin in the safest way possible, while preserving privacy.<br /> <br /> 'We do not collect any user identification information beyond email addresses. We also do not hold any keys. Therefore:<br /> </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We cannot 'freeze' our users' assets.</li> <li>We cannot 'prevent' them from being moved.</li> <li>We do not have knowledge of 'the existence, nature, value, and location' of our users' assets. This is by design.</li> </blockquote> </ul> <blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'Please look up how self custody and private keys work. When the Canadian dollar becomes worthless, we will be here to serve you, too.'<sup><a href='#fn144' id='fnref144' epub:type='noteref'>144</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Once the realization that bitcoin can in fact function without intermediaries sank in, Canadian authorities found they had few options: the Ontario Securities Commission fell back to censoring speech, since their colleagues in the province's courts were unable to censor transactions. They reported tweets by Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, which advocated the use of non-custodial wallets, to the police.<sup><a href='#fn145' id='fnref145' epub:type='noteref'>145</a></sup> (Both Kraken and Coinbase are centralized, custodial crypto exchanges which would in principle be forced to comply with orders to freeze accounts.)</p> <p>Given that the above tweets are still accessible through a Canadian VPN server at the time of writing, it seems this attempt at censorship was also unsuccessful.</p> <p>A couple other examples will help demonstrate that crypto's censorship resistance is not illusory. When Russia outlawed donations to Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, the prominent dissident urged his followers to donate using cryptocurrency.<sup><a href='#fn146' id='fnref146' epub:type='noteref'>146</a></sup> At the time of writing, the organization's website still lists addresses for several crypto networks, and judging by public blockchain data, the addresses continue to receive donations unimpeded.<sup><a href='#fn147' id='fnref147' epub:type='noteref'>147</a></sup></p> <p>The Russian state employs world-class hackers. Having actually poisoned Navalny, it would presumably have no qualms about seizing or freezing his organization's crypto assets. It doesn't because it's unable to.</p> <p>The ways around crypto's censorship resistance, as I mentioned earlier, are violence, physical intimidation and extortion. Cryptographers refer to a '$5 wrench' attack: there may be no known technical vector to crack someone's perfect encryption scheme, but if you can take a wrench to their face and hands while demanding the password, that doesn't matter.</p> <p>The Venezuelan state has adopted this philosophy in its battle against cryptocurrency users in the country. Venezuela is run by one of the world's least-competent socialist governments, and in the late 2010s the country was experiencing a profound economic crisis, characterized by severe shortages of food and medicine, blackouts, hyperinflation, and massive emigration. Seeing themselves as locked in an anti-imperialist struggle with the United States, the government banned the use of the dollar.</p> <p>As a result, Venezuela became one of the few places in the world ever to experience widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a day-to-day means of payment.<sup><a href='#fn148' id='fnref148' epub:type='noteref'>148</a></sup> The bolívar was worthless; dollars were unobtainable; but bitcoin – which could be mined using heavily subsidized, albeit intermittently available, electricity – could be gotten and used without the state's approval.</p> <p>The state soon expressed its displeasure, however.<sup><a href='#fn149' id='fnref149' epub:type='noteref'>149</a></sup> Its motives were twofold: first, ordinary Venezuelans were skirting the ban on dollars, or doing something that, to the police, sounded close enough (law is a fluid thing under Maduro); and second, elites in the security services – whose other sidelines include drug trafficking – wanted the bitcoin for themselves. The secret police arrested miners, accused them of vague offenses, confiscated their equipment (and presumably their bitcoin, in cases where the keys were stored on miners' computers) and used the hardware to mine bitcoin themselves.</p> <p>Crypto, used in isolation, is ineffective against physical force. Firearms can deliver promising results in this regard, but that's another topic.<sup><a href='#fn150' id='fnref150' epub:type='noteref'>150</a></sup></p> <p>I should clarify an additional point: as mentioned above, North Korea has managed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency. How is that consistent with my contention that no one – even nation states – can freeze or confiscate crypto? The answer is that North Korea is attacking not the base protocol (in most cases ethereum), but applications built on top of it.</p> <p>Let's say I build a lending and borrowing application on ethereum, but through an unfortunate oversight, I fail to properly secure a critical function in the smart contract. It should be the case that only the owner of a certain sum of collateral can call the <code>withdrawCollateral</code> function, but I've made a mistake that allows anyone to do so. A hacker – they could be anyone, but let's say they happen to be serving in the North Korean military – notices the vulnerability and starts withdrawing random users' collateral, netting a few million dollars.</p> <p>The ethereum protocol was not compromised. The hacker can't take these users' ether if it's just sitting in their wallet, or in any properly secured smart contract. They can only steal from my users because I've created an application allowing them to do so. We don't blame the C programming language, integrated circuits, the von Neumann architecture, or computing in general when buggy software causes a problem – even a catastrophic one. In almost every case, the software ran as written, the hardware behaved as instructed; the problem was in the instructions.<sup><a href='#fn151' id='fnref151' epub:type='noteref'>151</a></sup></p> <p>Alright then, enough about governments. What about exchanges? Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates stole something like $8 billion of their customers' crypto. How did they manage that?</p> <p>The answer is brutally simple: it was never their crypto. Morally, ethically, legally and by the common consent of all humankind, those assets belonged to the users who had purchased them. But according to the blockchain, they belonged to the person in control of their associated private keys: Sam and his colleagues.</p> <p><em>Not your keys, not your coins</em>, is the mantra that advocates of self-custody repeat.</p> <p>But whereas customers of a bank can't realistically take their life savings out in cash and 'self-custody' fiat currency that way (as I mentioned above, this is for all practical purposes illegal in the U.S. and much of Europe), customers of crypto exchanges can and should do just that. Unless you plan to trade it in the near term, there's no reason to keep a large amount of crypto on a centralized exchange. Empirically, they can't be trusted, and because the technology enables – <em>exists</em> to enable – self-custody, there's no need to trust them. </p> <p>Custodying your own crypto assets and keeping them safe from hackers, governments and government hackers may not be simple. In some cases, it might be infeasible. But it is possible in principle. No other asset allows you to do that, unless it's cash, diamonds or gold. And cash, diamonds and gold fall short of crypto in a couple key respects. They can't be instantly sent across the world. They can't be memorized: if you need to cross an especially hostile border, you can do so with your life savings stored in twelve words in your head.<sup><a href='#fn152' id='fnref152' epub:type='noteref'>152</a></sup></p> <p>Nor, as any added bonus, do the spatial dimensions of crypto scale with the value. You can store $50 or $500 million in the same USB stick, or using the same twelve words. You can't hide $500 million of gold in your suitcase or sew $500 million of gemstones into the lining of your clothes.</p> <h3>Privacy and cryptocurrency</h3> <p>Up to this point, I've skirted around an important topic; likely you've noticed. Cash grants its users basically unparalleled freedom to transact, for two reasons. First, it's physical. If some third party wants to censor your cash transaction, they'll need to be literally in the room with you. Second, it's anonymous. Unless your circumstances are exceedingly unique, you don't need to worry about marked bills.</p> <p>Crypto isn't physical. This fact introduces complications like the risk of hacking, but it's also an advantage. You can send it across the world in seconds; cash, less so. And as I argued above, crypto achieves censorship resistance in spite of the drawbacks of being digital.</p> <p>The other way crypto is unlike cash – and this is more of a problem – is that it isn't anonymous. For this reason, despite its obvious relevance to the right to transact, I've hardly discussed privacy.</p> <p>There's a historical reason for the lack of anonymity in crypto (or rather, in bitcoin and ethereum; other protocols confer better privacy). Satoshi Nakamoto solved the double-spend problem by creating a completely public ledger of all transactions. We can't exactly fault him (?): the problem had bested cryptographers for decades, and his solution enabled a decentralized network of miners to validate the ledger, dispensing with the trusted 'bank' at the center of the protocol. But this design came at the cost of privacy.</p> <p>In certain respects then, crypto marks a step backwards from cash. Without privacy, would-be censors can follow the precedent set by the Venezuelan secret police: find you, arrest you, and render your supposed freedom to transact null. We might question whether censorship resistance can truly exist in the absence of privacy.</p> <p>I don't have a clean answer to that question, and I won't wave it away. But I'll argue that, even if crypto sacrifices some of the advantages of cash, we shouldn't act as if there's some other, better option waiting in the wings, conveniently providing censorship resistance, privacy and the ability to transact at distances of more than literal arm's length.</p> <p>After all, cash's censorship resistance comes with a massive caveat: the state can demonetize some or all of the paper bills it's issued, any time it wants.</p> <p>The government can replace these now-worthless bills with new ones, backed by its full-if-conditional faith and credit, or it can simply not. 'Cashless society' is a favorite slogan of supranational policy organs like the IMF and WEF.<sup><a href='#fn153' id='fnref153' epub:type='noteref'>153</a></sup> The U.S., as detailed earlier, has made operating in cash all but illegal for businesses. And it's not as if no major economy would be crazy enough to pursue mass demonetization: India did it less than a decade ago.</p> <p>Governments may not be able to censor it all that well, but the fact remains that cash is issued by governments, and as such, subject to their whims. Crypto isn't.</p> <p>To be clear, I don't mean to frame cash and crypto as rivals. We don't need to pick one or the other. I'm emphatically in favor of retaining if not expanding cash's role in society, while expanding crypto's. But ideally we're able to rely exclusively on crypto, given the risk that governments remove physical cash from circulation.</p> <p>I'll pause here to address a potential source of confusion, because many people think that bitcoin and ethereum <em>are</em> in fact private, and that that's sort of their point. This impression is correct in the sense that you don't transact under your full name, permanent address, driver's license number <em>and we need one additional form of ID – do you have a current lease or voter registration card?</em><br /> <br /> You don't need to provide any information to open an account, which is just a string of letters and numbers. The numbers and letters themselves convey nothing. Here's an example:<sup><a href='#fn154' id='fnref154' epub:type='noteref'>154</a></sup> </p> <code>0xd5e099c71B797516c10ED0F0d895f429C2781142</code> <p><code>d5e09</code> is anonymous, except, not really. Since their entire transaction history can be parsed and analyzed, they're open to identification through any number of techniques, by any number of parties, till Judgment Day. Can some random online sleuth figure out who <code>d5e09</code> is today? Probably not. (Although I've seen it done.) </p> <p>Can the state? Almost certainly. And if not today, then soon. How did <code>d5e09</code> fund their wallet? If they bought from a centralized exchange, game over. The exchange has already shared their information with the government, or soon will. Does <code>d5e09</code> file taxes? Then they've given enough information about their crypto activity to identify their wallet and establish the link. </p> <p>Even if they obtained their crypto anonymously (by mining it, buying it with cash, stealing it, faking their KYC or using a no-KYC exchange), sooner or later they'll connect their wallet to some site that logs their IP address, links it to their wallet address, and sends both to the FBI in a nice CSV the first stern email they get.</p> <p>Let's say <code>d5e09</code> is too careful for any of that to work. They'll transact with some account that's less careful. Each address the state identifies, the smaller the anonymous portion of the network becomes, and the bigger the 'doxxed' (personally identified) portion grows. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: the remaining pieces get easier and easier to place. Remember also that the blockchain never expires. </p> <p>If you're still confident you have the operational security needed to stay anonymous, congratulations. For you, crypto is private. For most people, it's anything but.</p> <p>There is hope. I said earlier that we shouldn't act as though there's some additional option, neither cash nor bitcoin/ethereum but a secret third thing that's digital, private and censorship-resistant. </p> <p>But perhaps there is: crypto is more than just bitcoin and ethereum. Several protocols exist that let you transact in private, the most popular at the time of writing being Monero and Zcash. But good luck – unless you happen to be an expert in cryptography – deciding which privacy coin, if any, is private enough for your needs. Rumor and innuendo stalk this corner of the industry, with supporters of each technology decrying their rivals as compromised in one way or another, and vice-versa.<br /> <br /> Often enough, the critics hold deeply underwater speculative investments in their chosen coin, and know only what fellow bagholders on Reddit have told them to believe about the evil Other Coins. But dismiss the fear, uncertainty and doubt at your own peril. In 2022 the developers of Secret, another prominent privacy coin, disclosed a vulnerability that threatened the anonymity of users' transactions. No users were affected by the attack vector, they said, which white hat hackers alerted them to in time.<sup><a href='#fn155' id='fnref155' epub:type='noteref'>155</a></sup> </p> <p>But what if the NSA finds your vulnerability first? The NSA doesn't disclose these things. It uses them. So do any number of similarly resourced organizations around the world.<br /> <br /> I don't want to take a side in any Zcash-Monero beef, and I don't want to imply that Secret or anyone else is being owned unawares. I simply want to illustrate how hard it is for those seeking privacy in crypto. </p> <p>Particularly if you <em>need</em> privacy – if you're not just libertarian, but someone the state is specifically interested in identifying and neutralizing – the outlook is bleak. Governments go to extreme measures and play an absurdly long game when it comes to this sort of thing. For decades Crypto AG was the world's premier vendor of encrypted communication products. Israel bought its equipment, as did Egypt, Iran, Argentina and around 100 other countries. It was secretly owned by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who listened to any customer conversation it pleased and charged the victims millions for the privilege.<sup><a href='#fn156' id='fnref156' epub:type='noteref'>156</a></sup></p> <p>With that kind of precedent, how much research do you need to do on a privacy protocol before you can feel safe using it?</p> <p>Not that we should hold cryptocurrency to a higher standard than other technology. Privacy is basically impossible to guarantee in any digital communication. (<em>Gestures expansively toward Snowden revelations.</em>) Where the state takes a sincere interest in what you're saying or how you're spending your money, you should probably assume they know or will find out.</p> <p>Occasionally something happens that gives me some confidence the state can't crack a piece of privacy tech: they ban it. Perhaps Tornado Cash, which I'll explain in detail below, really did stump government sleuths. Not that I'd bet money on it, and not that it would be much comfort. If you're under American jurisdiction – which if you ask American courts, basically everyone is – you could face decades in prison for using Tornado Cash.</p> <p>Still, new innovations are arriving faster than the Treasury can sanction them, and the push to bring privacy to the base layer of ethereum is gathering steam. With any luck, the problem of privacy in crypto becomes much less acute over the next few years. And even if it doesn't, crypto still allows you to transact without permission or interference. You might just have to do so publicly.</p> <h3>Permissionlessness and its discontents</h3> <p>With any luck I've convinced you that crypto succeeds in its core purpose of censorship resistance.</p> <p>But that's not the same as convincing you that crypto is <em>worth it</em>. What about all the other promises people have made about crypto: that it would fix remittances, destroy the Federal Reserve, bank the unbanked, end ad-funded social media through micropayments, something about 'the metaverse' – that it would make us all rich?</p> <p>I can't speak to any of the many promises people make about crypto, except the one. The technology may yet accomplish some or all of the above. Personally I doubt it manages more than one or two, if that. Crypto was built to do one thing, and it does it well.</p> <p>Why then must we put up with all this empty hype and the scams and Ponzi schemes it gives rise to? Is censorship resistance worth the hurricane of snake oil? You're free to decide it's not. (I would of course disagree with you.) But it's important to understand why we can't have one without the other.</p> <p>Recall the <em>bank</em> that early attempts to create cryptographically secured digital currency relied on: a trusted, centralized intermediary. None of these protocols ever enjoyed any level of adoption, because they had no reason to exist. We can already send money electronically by relying on a trusted, centralized intermediary. To remove the single point of failure – the referee who could rob you, turn authoritarian, prove incompetent or betray your trust in any number of other ways – the protocol needed to be entirely decentralized and permissionless.</p> <p>Crypto is <em>permissionless</em> because anyone is allowed to help maintain it by validating new transactions (in bitcoin this is known as 'mining') – even criminals and dictators and heretics of every stripe. No one needs to be granted permission, because that requirement presupposes an authority to do the granting: a central point of failure, a bank.</p> <p>To take control of the bitcoin network and deny someone's ability to transact, more than 50% of the miners (measured by computing power) would need to collude. This could happen, but it hasn't yet, and given that no one can keep anyone out of the network based on any criteria but the ability to run software compatible with the protocol, the risk seems manageable.</p> <p>And since anyone can validate new transactions, anyone can transact. A particular miner might decline to process your transaction, for whatever reason. No matter, another one will process it within seconds or perhaps, depending on the network, minutes. This means censorship resistance, and censorship resistance means scams.</p> <p>People are excited about cryptocurrency. It's new, it's growing rapidly, it's made people rich. They were excited about tech stocks in the 90s, bonds in the 80s, any and all stocks in the 20s, railroads in the 1840s, the South Sea Company in 1720. People get excited about novel financial opportunities, and when they do, unscrupulous people make extravagant promises that end up irradiating the funds of those greedy or gullible enough to trust them.</p> <p>If crypto were a permissioned system, it might be possible to keep the scammers out – not that existing permissioned financial platforms, like stock exchanges, have a shining track record in this regard. But if crypto were a permissioned system, it would not exist. It would have no purpose.</p> <p>You might object: censorship resistance doesn't just enable Ponzis and pump-and-dumps, but more serious wrongdoing: tax evasion, drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, terrorist financing and more.</p> <p>First of all, compared to the legacy financial system, it really doesn't – not yet, anyway. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm that counts multiple government agencies among its clients, illicit transactions accounted for just 0.24% of cryptocurrency transactions by volume in 2022. In absolute terms, that's $20.6 billion – not nothing, but paltry in both relative and absolute terms, when you compare it to the fiat world.<sup><a href='#fn157' id='fnref157' epub:type='noteref'>157</a></sup> The Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade puts the figure for overall worldwide illicit trade at 8-15% of global GDP – several trillion dollars.<sup><a href='#fn158' id='fnref158' epub:type='noteref'>158</a></sup> </p> <p>Even so, I can accept that crypto is theoretically suitable for money laundering and tax evasion. (Ignoring the fact that most protocols commit every transaction to a transparent, permanent, public ledger, which seems inconvenient.) As crypto's role in the economy grows, I have little doubt, so will its role in the illicit economy. And none of the criminal or otherwise antisocial behavior that bitcoin and the like might enable should simply be waved away.</p> <h3>The regulatory agenda</h3> <p>But accepting that premise, what do those who would surveil and control – or as they put it, 'regulate' – the crypto market wish to accomplish? Would they clean up this market the way they have the world's most highly regulated banks? As we've seen, those institutions clean and hide torrents of criminal proceeds from the tax authorities, no less today than five or ten regulatory crackdowns ago.</p> <p>Speaking of which, what do these crackdowns entail? Politicians denounce the big banks for their role in financial malfeasance. And they propose a solution: to tighten up financial regulations, that is, to require that more paperwork be filed on what the rules call <em>suspicious activity</em>. </p> <p>This system hardly hurts the big banks. In the long run, it benefits them: they can afford to spend marginally more on <em>compliance</em>, as the paperwork-filing is called, while their smaller competitors can't. So the big banks eat the little ones, growing bigger. As an added bonus, they look appealingly meek and law-abiding: see how many reports we've filed? How much <em>suspicious activity</em> we've rooted out? Aren't we diligent in abiding by the will of the people, as expressed through their duly elected lawmakers?</p> <p>The suspicious activity reports aren't acted on, as mentioned earlier, either by bankers or regulators, but every few years the accumulated weight of wrongdoing breaks some invisible dam, and a big fine does come. It's long since been budgeted for. The headlines last a week, the damage to profits and bonuses a quarter, the televised excoriation by Congress a few hours. (Even the previously mentioned $1.3 billion Westpac paid in 2020, while it ended the CEO's tenure, didn't prevent the bank from turning a profit that same year.<sup><a href='#fn159' id='fnref159' epub:type='noteref'>159</a></sup>)</p> <p>This system benefits the politicians as well: they get to be seen grilling bankers from on high, 'getting tough' by writing still more regulations, acting as tribunes of the people. Since in the end they only make the richest bankers richer, they can count on donations during their career and 'speaking fees' (bribes in arrears) upon retirement.</p> <p>Most of all, however, this system benefits law enforcement: they can gorge on a wealth of sensitive financial data without needing to trouble themselves about the Fourth Amendment. Banks can't allow suspicious activity, after all; they have to file reports. And courts can't force cops to jump through hoops and obtain warrants for information the banks are already offering freely (<em>freely</em>, as required by statute).</p> <p>The result of all this 'regulation' is not a cleaner financial system; it is, in the words of Coin Center's Neeraj K. Agrawal, a 'warrantless surveillance regime.' And it's built, again in Agrawal's words, on a single key assumption: 'that people would always need intermediaries to transact.'<sup><a href='#fn160' id='fnref160' epub:type='noteref'>160</a></sup></p> <p>This is why bankers, politicians, law enforcement and their hangers-on (journalists in particular) want to pin crime, money laundering, tax evasion, terrorist financing and the rest on crypto. They want to incorporate it into this system, to introduce intermediaries into the equation or turn existing participants into intermediaries, so that they can lean on someone to spy on customers, donate to campaigns, look meek during hearings, pay speaking fees.</p> <p>They know – at least the sophisticated ones do – that the overwhelming majority of financial filth passes through the legacy financial system's plumbing.<sup><a href='#fn161' id='fnref161' epub:type='noteref'>161</a></sup> They know their system wouldn't prevent the same outcome in crypto. Stopping financial crime is not the point.</p> <p>The problem, from their perspective, is that a crypto transaction requires no intermediaries. Miners and validators might seem to fit this description, but because no one can dictate who can (or can't) play those roles, how they must behave, or what paperwork they have to file, miners are effectively abstracted away: between one user and another, there lies only a protocol. </p> <p>When a new block of transactions comes up for validation, someone, let's call him Bob, must of course do the actual validation. Bob could go rogue and try to cheat users out of their funds; the network will reject this attempt without the need for any human intervention; these defenses are built into the software. Bob could also attempt to police his fellow users according to some scheme extraneous to the protocol: enforcing U.S. sanctions against Iran, say, or refusing to process donations to a certain political campaign.</p> <p>This will work for a few seconds, until it's time to process a new batch of transactions, and a different validator who doesn't share Bob's scruples processes the ones he refused to. Bob has no way to impose his will on the network. Transactions which are valid according to the protocol – which incorporates no statutes, morals or KYC/AML requirements (you can read the code to be sure)<sup><a href='#fn162' id='fnref162' epub:type='noteref'>162</a></sup> – will go through without noticeable delay. There is no intermediary.</p> <p>Until relatively recently, the above assertions seemed theoretically sound, but remained untested. Nothing on the order of a military and economic superpower had tried to impose a specific, additional constraint on a crypto protocol, to test whether it could insert itself as a sort of shadow intermediary.</p> <p>Then in August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the division of the U.S. Treasury tasked with imposing economic sanctions on foreign baddies, added an ethereum defi application to its list of sanctioned entities. Tornado Cash is a privacy tool that takes deposits of ether, mixes them together with clever cryptography, and allows the depositor to withdraw to a new, fresh address. It breaks the link that ethereum's public ledger establishes between the various addresses a user might control. It lets privacy-conscious users buy an NFT or deploy a smart contract without the whole world knowing the rest of their on-chain transaction history. It also allows North Korean hackers to clean their stolen money.</p> <p>So in a first for the office, OFAC sanctioned a machine.<sup><a href='#fn163' id='fnref163' epub:type='noteref'>163</a></sup> Many applications on ethereum depend on a degree of human input. One or more human developers need to be involved for the application's value proposition to be fulfilled. Not Tornado Cash. The protocol continued to work despite one of its developers being thrown in jail (for months, without charges, in a Western democracy, while prosecutors seized his car and threatened to auction it off).<sup><a href='#fn164' id='fnref164' epub:type='noteref'>164</a></sup></p> <p>In principle, a person under American jurisdiction could face the same sort of penalty for facilitating a Tornado Cash transaction as they would for doing business with a Syrian war criminal. And yet it was never difficult to get a Tornado Cash transaction processed. A significant proportion of ethereum validators, wishing to avoid long stints in federal prison, complied with the sanctions and declined to validate any transaction touching the application.<sup><a href='#fn165' id='fnref165' epub:type='noteref'>165</a></sup> But hundreds of such transactions went through the day after the sanctions were imposed, just as they had the day before.</p> <p>Even bringing its most draconian punishments to bear on the issue, the U.S. can't regulate an individual ethereum application out of existence. Ethereum has no intermediaries, so there is no one for it to bring the hammer down on. Its friends in the Dutch courts can punish the software developer who created the machine, but once it's deployed, no one can stop the machine from running.</p> <p>This is only the most dramatic example of the state's attempts to turn crypto into a set of intermediaries. In 2021, as part of a bill funding infrastructure improvements, Congress updated the definition of a 'broker' for tax purposes to include miners, validators, and not a few hardware manufacturers and software developers. These actors – or some subset of them, the correct interpretation of the law remains unclear at the time of writing – will be required to file tax forms on behalf of their 'customers,' that is, pseudonymous participants in the network, who could be anyone living in any jurisdiction.<sup><a href='#fn166' id='fnref166' epub:type='noteref'>166</a></sup> </p> <p>Under crypto networks' current design, a miner or defi developer knows a user by their address, a pseudonymous string of numbers and letters, such as <code>0xe03c23519e18d64f144d2800e30e81b0065c48b5</code>. This address' on-chain activity and balances are public, but there's no way of knowing who the address belongs to, or what other addresses that person might control. There's certainly no way of obtaining the user's full legal name, street address and tax identification number in order to fill out a 1099.</p> <p>The protocols won't be updated to accommodate this new reporting requirement. Those who feel they must comply will stop participating, leaving non-Americans, those brave enough to defy the IRS, those ignorant of the law, and those who were already breaking it anyway.</p> <p>The state relies on intermediaries, not to prevent bad people from doing bad things, but to surveil and control the people under its jurisdiction. Because of crypto, these people no longer need intermediaries.</p> <p>So we'll have a War on Crypto – or rather, we already do: it started sometime in 2021. Like preceding wars on things that can't sign treaties – poverty, drugs, terror – it will cost a lot of money, erode a lot of rights, fill a lot of jail cells and provide fodder for a lot of speeches. I very much doubt it will kill crypto.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>We should hope that it doesn't. The right to transact is important. We have enjoyed it by default since money first arose. Without it, we're likely to suffer indignities, violations of basic liberties, perhaps atrocities. And even if we were to give up a right of such long standing – which we should emphatically not – the case must be made to us. We need to have a debate, an election, a fight, not an obscure slurry of bureaucratic rules that few notice, fewer remark on, and everyone suffers as a result of.</p> <p><em>But money laundering</em> is not sufficient justification.</p> <p>And if we wish to safeguard our right to transact, the one technology we have at our disposal is cryptocurrency. There is no other tool that enables people to transact at a distance without intermediaries. If it existed, I'd weigh it against crypto. Truth be told I might be prejudiced in its favor: it's been a long few years. The fact is no such third option exists.</p> <p>We can and should introduce 'the right to transact' into the everyday civic lexicon – make it as ubiquitous as 'free speech' and 'due process.' We can and should pass laws protecting it, found organizations to lobby and litigate in its favor, pass a constitutional amendment enshrining it. I support all of the above and more.</p> <p>But the margin between a constitutional democracy governed by the rule of law and the many less-pleasant alternatives can be as thin as one eventful afternoon. When the wise laws and just precedents are gone, when the elegant debating points get you thrown in a cage, our surest guarantee of liberty is censorship-resistant money, encoded in software that anyone can run without permission.</p> <h2>Closing thoughts</h2> <p><em>Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.</em></p> <p>Harry S. Truman</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I started working on this essay at some point in 2021. I had a title, more or less – I hadn't decided between the 'right' or 'freedom' to transact – and a few years of obsession with cryptocurrency under my belt, but it was hard to give the thesis any real shape.</p> <p>PayPal had been exercising arbitrary, quasi-moralist rule over its user base for years, but so what? One largish company behaving badly isn't a reason to revisit the social contract. 'CBDC' was an acronym wrapped around the vaguest proposition: what if the central bank issued its money, you know, digitally? Portraying it as an imminent threat to human liberty seemed unconvincing.</p> <p>But it was clear, as covid lockdowns stretched into a second year, that a new and bleak chapter in the history of authoritarian overreach was being written. Every sort of institution – media, academia, government, law enforcement, nonprofits, tech, pharma – closed ranks against dissent of any sort. So did many workplaces and families.</p> <p>The consensus was that there were two pandemics: the literal virus and the virus of heresy, necessitating a strict intellectual lockdown to stop the spread. Anyone who questioned the orthodoxy – however circumscribed their objections or sound their reasoning – was an antivaxer, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist. (An Arian, a Cathar, a Monophysite.) It was the duty of all right-thinking people – however close their relationship to the heathen – to deny them bread and water.</p> <p>I felt this moral spasm made the freedom to transact all the more important, and that – ironically, given the parabolic run crypto was on at the time – no one was talking about it.</p> <p>But I had so little to point to in the way of concrete violations of this freedom. I rambled for a dozen pages or so about what-ifs and the Principle of the Thing. I fought the urge to give up.</p> <p>As I write, I have a very different problem. Every day some corporate executive, bureaucrat or politician commits some further outrage against the right to transact. Every time I knock the last item off my to-write list – <em>just mention this one last thing and you can call it quits, just this one last thing</em> – a new one last thing appears.</p> <p> The shift began with the Canadian government's order to freeze its political opponents' assets without any hint of due process. Then it accelerated. I wish I could feel some vindication that my sense of foreboding in 2021 had some basis, but I don't. I feel anger, foreboding, and an inability to catch up.<br /> <br /> I want to apologize for the disjointed nature of much of this essay. It's a direct result of being overtaken by events – of continuously realizing I need to stuff some fresh Development into the text, and watching what little structure it had disintegrate. </p> <p>But mostly I want to thank you for reading this far. This topic has consumed me for the better part of two years, and it means everything to me that you care.</p> <p>We are on a dangerous path, and the more people who realize it and can talk about it coherently – a bar I'm not at all sure I've cleared – the better our chances of avoiding disaster.</p> <p>For millennia, we've been able to buy and sell among ourselves without worrying whether some earthly power would log our every transaction or somehow step in to stop us. This freedom wasn't a matter of enlightened principle or a statute inherited from dim antiquity; it was a practical reality. Even the most paranoid tyrants of the modern era didn't imagine they could somehow inject their diktats into the medium of exchange.</p> <p>Their successors plan to. The next crop of despots is harnessing currency itself to their yoke – or harnessing us to the yoke of their currency – and few of us realize it. We need to fight this agenda in legislatures, courts, board rooms, living rooms, restaurants and bars. We need laws to protect the right to transact, norms to provide it a buffer, memes to make it intelligible.</p> <p>And more importantly, we need to build, adopt and use the one set of technology currently capable of providing an exit from this nightmare: cryptocurrency.</p> <p>One life, it's worth an attempt.</p> <h2>About the author</h2> <p>My name is Zelinar XY, or ZXY for short.

Worse, the pattern is fractal: no amount of zooming in will show you where the bright dividing lines between factions lie. Ideologies, loyalties and identities are as likely to be tangled and incoherent within a single person's head, particularly over a few years, as they are within a larger community. Government, being in large part made up of 'the people,' reproduces this complexity. So do industry, media, civil society, the military, organized crime, big men, old families, unions and religious institutions, any one or combination of which could be more relevant to a given power struggle than the government per se. So when I fall back on references to 'the state' and 'ordinary people' or similar phrases, it's a shorthand.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn2' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref2'>2.</a> For a brilliant discussion of the profound effects even half-forgotten inventions like the telegraph had on humans' relationship with the worlds of things and ideas, see Gleick.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn3' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref3'>3.</a> After I wrote this section, stories came to light that demonstrate a much closer relationship between U.S. social media companies and the government than even my deeply cynical assumptions led me to expect.

They're not contracts: they don't define agreements between parties who sign onto them. There's no agreement, no parties, no signing. They're not 'smart' in the sense purveyors of consumer gadgetry use the term – which is too vague to really pin down, but might imply some sort of automation. Smart contracts can't take any action at all unless prompted by a user, who sends a transaction to that contract over the network. Left to their own devices, smart contracts do exactly nothing.</p> <p>Here's what a smart contract is: it's a software application, but instead of being installed on a laptop or served through a website, it lives on ethereum's global decentralized computer. It can do anything its programmer designs it to, with whatever inputs its users choose to give it. It can be buggy. It can be a scam. It can be benign and flawlessly designed. It can be simple or complex. Ethereum is a Turing-complete environment, so a smart contract can be coded do anything any other software can. The catch is that it can be extremely expensive to use compared to normal software, if you're not careful.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we're stuck with the term 'smart contract,' unhelpful though it is, because it was coined well before ethereum, or even bitcoin, was invented, and it's too deeply entrenched to change.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn86' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref86'>86.</a> International Monetary Fund.

In extreme cases, people can lose their land, job, right to reside in a country, or assets. But presenting as a solution an even stricter identity regime, to which the ability to use digital money would now be tied, is exactly backwards: the state is the one demanding proof of identity in the first place, through regulations it imposes on private actors, if not directly. It is not a disinterested party stepping in to rescue the paperless from the caprice of whoever's out there demanding people's papers. Almost anyone who asks for your papers does so at the behest of the government. Ordinary people seldom yearn for universal, inescapable identities – serial numbers they can never slough off.

In a permissioned system, this assumption doesn't hold, so there's no need for a cumbersome system of decentralized validation. If a misbehaving node can simply be kicked off the network, a 'distributed ledger' becomes a needlessly slow database.</p> <p>The DLT idea emerged during the 2016-2018 cryptocurrency hype cycle, when self-styled innovators in the banking sector wished to capture some of the attention, talent and investment that bitcoin and its ilk had attracted. Permissionless, decentralized bearer assets being anathema to regulated financial institutions, the bankers framed DLT as an improvement on the 'Wild West' of crypto: all the benefits, but now with KYC/AML.</p> <p>In fact, the benefits of crypto, as bitcoin's early adopters conceived them, consisted in the elimination of – or at least escape from – banks. The other benefits bankers at the time cited (speed, cost savings, efficiency) existed only in comparison to the teetering, decades-old mess that was banks' half-digitized back office architecture, if at all. Crypto was slow and expensive to use, because it was designed to work reliably in an anarchic environment of mutual hostility. (This remains basically true, though incremental improvements to transaction speed and cost have been made.)<br /> </p> <p>Bitcoin has no custodians or cops who can intervene in the system to freeze or confiscate assets. Banks are custodians empowered to do just that, often at the behest of the cops. In such an environment, the tech behind cryptocurrency has scant relevance. If the system is centralized, why build a distributed ledger? Better to choose a fast, reliable, centralized database.</p> <p>The DLT idea persists, however. And however convoluted its logic, it probably works well enough in practice, only because almost any freshly designed system would be an improvement over the status quo.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn106' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref106'>106.</a> European Central Bank, 'Digital euro experimentation scope and key learnings,' p. 6.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn107' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref107'>107.</a> Bank for International Settlements et al. 2020.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn108' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref108'>108.</a> European Central Bank 2020, p. 2.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn109' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref109'>109.</a> Show VL.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn110' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref110'>110.</a> I imagine that by the time many of you are reading this, AI deep fakes will be more or less perfect.

I could, for example, set up a 'three-of-five' multisig, which requires three addresses out of a pool of five to sign a transaction before it can be executed. One address might be tied to a 'hot' wallet on my laptop. Another might be tied to a 'cold' hardware wallet I keep in a safe deposit box. My brother might hold onto a third. And so on. Now the attacker needs to convince several people to give up the goods, and/or gain control of several devices in disparate places.

The organization churns out a steady stream of stories alleging tax evasion and money laundering by states, multinational corporations, banks, terrorists and organized criminals. The plodding cadence of revelations – Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Pandora Papers, FinCEN Files, Luanda Leaks, Mauritius Leaks, West Africa Leaks – suggests that the system of financial surveillance built up in recent decades, along with the 'crackdowns' announced by embarrassed governments following each new revelation, are ineffective.<br /> </p> <p>Also notable is how little crypto is mentioned in these leaks (<a href='https://www.icij.org/?s=crypto'>https://www.icij.org/?s=crypto</a>). The vast majority of articles using the term are quoting or paraphrasing embarrassed government officials, who argue that if they could only have more funds and power to surveil dark corners of the financial system – especially cryptocurrency – all this malfeasance would end. See, for example, the head of FinCEN lamenting the 'budget situation' after the agency was found to be doing nothing to stop money laundering, despite its vast, existing surveillance powers (Woodman). The investigation into FinCEN's failure doesn't mention crypto once. FinCEN's chief mentions it repeatedly (Leopold et al.).</p> <p>In a couple of articles, the ICIJ mentions misconduct by centralized crypto exchanges or outright scammers. I've shared my thoughts on centralized exchanges above.</p> <p>I've only found one specific instance of cryptocurrency being used as a vehicle for money laundering in ICIJ's corpus: Alexander Vinnik, the operator of a Russian centralized crypto exchange, used his business as a vehicle for money laundering (Sadek et al.). Frankly, I would have expected more examples. I suppose the legacy financial system is simply too reliable and effective a vehicle for financial crimes for crypto to compete with it.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn162' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref162'>162.</a> bitcoin; go-ethereum.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn163' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref163'>163.</a> U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn164' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref164'>164.</a> Schickler; Khatri.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn165' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref165'>165.</a> Nijkerk.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn166' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref166'>166.</a> Goldberg et al.</p> </aside> </body> </html>

Centralized control over the ability to buy and sell was impossible, as was centralized surveillance of individual transactions.</p> <p>This freedom was a good thing, and now, as a result of rapidly evolving technology, it's disappearing.</p> <p>The Canadian government has invoked emergency powers to freeze protesters' bank accounts without due process. PayPal has declared its intention to monitor users' speech and fine them for expressing views the company considers objectionable. </p> <p>Across the industrialized world, central banks are planning to replace national currencies with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These will enable states to track and, if they wish, block or reverse any monetary transaction, no matter how trivial.</p> <p>We can't accept this outcome. The freedom to transact needs to be seen as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. To do otherwise risks forfeiting protections we once took for granted against potentially horrific abuse: the ability to earn money and spend it on daily necessities without seeking the approval of powerful, unaccountable institutions.</p> <h2>Definitions</h2> <p>This essay will make frequent use of a few terms that might not be familiar. They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.</p> <h3>Censorship resistance</h3> <p><em>Censorship resistance </em>refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.</p> <p>No messaging app, however, is fully censorship-<em>proof</em>. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: <em>censorship-resistant</em>.</p> <p>The concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.</p> <p>Censorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as <em>non-confiscatable</em>. </p> <p>An example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.</p> <p>I should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.</p> <p>Bitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like<br /> <br /> <code>bc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj</code><br /> <br /> – and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.) </p> <h3>Permissionlessness</h3> <p><em>Permissionlessness</em> refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're <em>permissioned</em>): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.</p> <p>Bitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.</p> <h3>Decentralization</h3> <p><em>Decentralization </em>refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are <em>centralized</em>. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.</p> <p>Bitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.</p> <p>Decentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.</p> <h2>Initial thoughts</h2> <p><em>Imagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.</em></p> <p>Suzuha</p> <p><br /></p> <p>A right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them <em>rights</em> in the first place.</p> <p>We say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.</p> <p>By the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.</p> <p>Certainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.</p> <p>And granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.</p> <p>So why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.</p> <p>If people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.</p> <p>The other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.</p> <p>Such permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.</p> <p>But shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.<sup><a href='#fn1' id='fnref1' epub:type='noteref'>1</a></sup> But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.</p> <p>Take speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.</p> <p>In recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.</p> <p>On the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.</p> <p>After the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.<sup><a href='#fn2' id='fnref2' epub:type='noteref'>2</a></sup> From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.</p> <p>Today powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.<sup><a href='#fn3' id='fnref3' epub:type='noteref'>3</a></sup> Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.</p> <p>Ordinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'<sup><a href='#fn4' id='fnref4' epub:type='noteref'>4</a></sup>) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.</p> <p>Complex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.</p> <p>Phil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'<sup><a href='#fn5' id='fnref5' epub:type='noteref'>5</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Today, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.</p> <p>Today we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.</p> <p>Technological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.</p> <p>A state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.</p> <p>We need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.</p> <p>Within recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.<sup><a href='#fn6' id='fnref6' epub:type='noteref'>6</a></sup>)</p> <p>Credit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.</p> <p>No one used payment apps. No one used any apps.</p> <p>The beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.</p> <p>By and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.</p> <p>Several factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.</p> <p>But I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.</p> <p>Today, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.</p> <p>In any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.</p> <p>Given past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,<sup><a href='#fn7' id='fnref7' epub:type='noteref'>7</a></sup> but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.</p> <p>The topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.</p> <p>To the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.</p> <p>The generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.</p> <p>Orwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.</p> <p>To revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological contagion. According to the Annals of Lorsch, the emperor requested a copy of a history of the papacy from Pope Adrian I in 774. The book, which to be clear, had already been written, took a year to be hand-copied and transported over the Alps.</p> <p>That was the velocity at which the two most powerful men in western Europe, the heirs of Peter the apostle and Caesar Augustus, could transmit information. Both would have been flummoxed by our anxiety over the instantaneous, global spread of heresy – sorry, <em>misinformation</em> – via light pulsing through massive cables at the bottom of the sea. </p> <p>Twelve centuries later, people's grasp of current and emerging technological capabilities is so unevenly distributed that we walk the earth simultaneously with Charlemagnes, Morses, Daguerres, Bells, Diffies and Berners-Lees.<sup><a href='#fn8' id='fnref8' epub:type='noteref'>8</a></sup> Some of us, including the most powerful among us, don't consider how control of digital payment rails could pose a threat to anyone; others are launching us into a future so new and strange that vanishingly few people understand the risks and opportunities. Likely they themselves don't understand.</p> <p>We won't have centuries to figure out the implications of credit cards – to say nothing of fully programmable money under centralized bureaucratic control in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p> <p>CBDCs are one of the main concerns of this essay, and I'll go into borderline-excessive detail about them later on, but briefly: they are digital currency issued directly by central banks. Take Europe as an example. The European Central Bank issues the euro, and for the most part, euros are already digital; physical coins and bills make up a fraction of the total value of the currency. But the 'digital euro,' or whatever it ends up being called, will mark a sharp departure from how the euro works today.</p> <p>As a CBDC, it will incorporate a complete record of every transaction in which it's used. This record will be available to bureaucrats and, by extension, politicians and law enforcement. Today, your bank knows when you spend euros deposited with them, or receive them to your account. But the central bank and the rest of the EU government don't know. They likely have some idea – perhaps more than you think – but their picture is necessarily incomplete.</p> <p>With a CBDC, the state will receive a complete, real-time stream of all transaction data. Following the elimination of cash – a goal closely associated with the introduction of CBDCs – there will be no legal way to transact outside of this government panopticon.</p> <p>The state will also be able to control CBDC transactions: freeze your account, confiscate your funds, prevent you from sending money to or receiving it from certain parties – whoever the state deems unfit. The rules governing how money works could in principle be arbitrarily complex and liable to change at any time.</p> <p>Banks can act this way today, and sometimes they do – often enough, when they do, it's at the behest of the state. But with a CBDC, the government will be able to intervene directly – no need to go through private-sector intermediaries who might make a fuss. Arbitrary limitations on the freedom to transact and summary seizures of funds might of course be illegal, but the question could quickly become academic. When violating the law at scale becomes so easy, the government might be hard to convince to do otherwise, especially when it can instantly revoke its critics' ability to buy food.</p> <p>For the moment, CBDCs are more idea than reality. But world leaders are openly discussing their development and introduction. China is already testing a prototype at scale. The Bahamas has deployed one nationwide, the only country to do so – although almost no one uses it. In Europe and the U.S., bureaucratic and legislative wheels are turning. Journalists are being primed.</p> <p>The same Turing completeness that lets you build a website that can look like anything and do anything with any data you give it, will determine the degree to which currency can be configured, manipulated and controlled. Drain the account of a single dissident; confiscate $200 from every resident of Los Angeles; give $50 to anyone who voted a certain way – hell, anyone born in July. The possibilities are endless.</p> <p>Of course nothing is (entirely) new under the sun. Authorities have been seizing and doling out assets for millennia: the story of the Knights Templar comes to mind as a dramatic and well-known pre-modern example of punitive confiscation. But if Philip IV of France could seize the bodies and assets of 100-something individuals, he could never have dreamed of issuing an order that would render all the coinage in an entire district worthless instantly.</p> <p>That's the sort of fearsome miracle central banks might be able to carry out in a few years: update a database row, tweak a configuration, perhaps for the really tough cases, write a few lines of code, <em>et voilà</em>.</p> <p>As Matt Odell, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, has written, the preferred interface for this kind of thing is likely to be an AI chat bot, which 'seems ideal for weaponizing massive surveillance databases way more efficiently than current search tools.' (He provides an example input: 'close the bank accounts of anyone who went to the anti government protest in Paris last week.')<sup><a href='#fn9' id='fnref9' epub:type='noteref'>9</a></sup></p> <p>By combining streams of near-perfect surveillance, the state will be able to view an individual's physical movements, reading material, expressions of opinion, social interactions and monetary transactions as a unified whole. They will have the ability to instantaneously throttle or halt the economic activity of individual dissidents and entire social groups.</p> <p>In the U.S., this outcome still lies somewhere over the horizon – how far is anyone's guess – and may even be avoided to some appreciable degree. In China, this reality has already begun to take shape.</p> <p>Beginning in April 2022, banks in the central Chinese province of Henan suspended cash withdrawals, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without access to their savings. The following month, hundreds of protesters traveled to Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, to demand the return of their money. When they planned to repeat the protest that June, however, many found themselves unable to leave their homes. The government had falsely diagnosed them with covid, flipping the health codes on the would-be protesters' phones to red. Under the draconian lockdown regime in place in China at that time, this was the equivalent of placing them under house arrest.<sup><a href='#fn10' id='fnref10' epub:type='noteref'>10</a></sup></p> <p>The mechanism for social control in this case wasn't a CBDC – though China has been actively testing one in a growing number of provinces since 2020 – but it's easy enough to see the template behind these actions: centralized institutions (according to protesters, the banks are connected to political power brokers) seize people's assets, then prevent their victims from causing trouble by restricting their movements.</p> <p>Both steps could be accomplished more efficiently using a CBDC: you can go protest in Zhengzhou, no problem, as long as you don't need to pay for transportation or fuel or food.</p> <p>Fortunately, even as new technologies are enabling sinister authoritarianism, they are providing a means of escape. A parallel financial system built on cryptocurrency protocols has begun to take shape. This system has defied censorship or control by even the most determined and powerful global actors, and it's only becoming stronger and more resilient. (Its relationship to surveillance is complex, simplifying it at times, frustrating at others, but it effectively thwarts attempts at censorship.)</p> <p>Proponents of the emerging crypto financial system often stress the minimization of trust: you don't control your crypto assets when a custodian has promised to hold them for you, or the courts have vowed to protect them, or the architects of the system have assured you its source code is safe and benign. You control your crypto assets when, and only when, you're the only one in control of the cryptographic keys, and the software encoding the system is open for you and all the world to scrutinize, tinker with and attack.</p> <p>This is all perfectly true. And it goes some way towards accomplishing a laudable goal: obviating the whole discussion of 'rights,' at least as far as money is concerned. Bankers, payment processors, politicians and bureaucrats will respect the sanctity of your rights, right up until the moment they don't. Ethereum, bitcoin and their ilk are machines. You can see the code they run on, and those are the rules. They are indifferent to moral panics, social engineering, dot plots and managerial maneuvering.</p> <p>This description does not, of course, apply equally well to all cryptocurrencies, some of which are very much centralized. At the time of writing, though, protocols such as bitcoin and ethereum are credibly decentralized, neutral and censorship-resistant. Nor am I aware of a technology outside of cryptocurrency that accomplishes anything comparable.</p> <p>If the technology exists to escape the slide into financial tyranny, then why write a polemic about the <em>right to transact?</em> Will invoking a slogan protect our freedoms better than building decentralized, censorship-resistant systems? Wouldn't my time be better spent implementing the latest research into, say, zero-knowledge proofs – or the nearest thing my skill set allows?</p> <p>Don't cypherpunks write code?<sup><a href='#fn11' id='fnref11' epub:type='noteref'>11</a></sup></p> <p>My answer is that our technological arsenal is critical, but not enough on its own. We need social consensus on what the technology means and what ends it serves. Do elliptic curves care about our ideologies? Of course not. The shapes rotate on, elegant, indifferent, unstoppable. <em>E pur si muove.</em> But without an ideological, moral, political – in short, a memetic – component, we can't make the case for adopting these technologies at scale. We can't develop arguments to prevent them from being defanged, backdoored, persecuted, or regulated into docility. </p> <p>We need an intellectual arsenal to fight the already-very-much-underway backlash by that sadly large cohort in every place and time that wants to be coerced.</p> <p>Nor can even the most sublimely implemented blockchain hold the violence of the state at bay, at least not directly: they may never be able to block or reverse a single transaction, but they can send men with guns to your house and put you in a cage. They may even take your private keys in the process. A pervasive cultural sense that people have a right to transact helps reduce that risk. A law or constitutional amendment would be even better – while clearly recognizing that all of it would be meaningless absent the power of the protocols themselves.</p> <p>But in all seriousness, if you're reading this and think your time is better spent building freedom-preserving cryptography – I agree. Put this down and get back to it. Please hurry.</p> <p>Only a handful of people are likely to be raising that objection, though, and in any case, they're already sold on the arguments I care about. We share a fundamental commitment to the freedom to transact, they're just purists. (Or as they might put it, I'm a tourist.)</p> <p>Other, much larger groups of people will have different and more fundamental hesitations about the wisdom or usefulness of this 'right to transact.' In the rest of this essay, I'll attempt to address those as best I can. For now, here's the short version.</p> <p>First: the freedom to transact we enjoyed until very recently was a good thing. It deserves to be regarded as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. Doing so involves significant risks and tradeoffs, but the downsides are much exaggerated. Due process has downsides. Protections against unreasonable search and seizure have downsides. We accept them for good reason, and those who would erode these rights are usually concerned not so much with safety, fairness, justice and the rest, as they are with imposing control over a cowed populace. This is the case with the right to transact.</p> <p>Second: this right, so long enjoyed in practice without being discussed, because it seemed natural and was hardly ever threatened, is now rapidly disappearing. This is a harmful process that should be stopped and reversed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Or if not, if abolishing the freedom to transact is somehow a good thing, the people who think so need to make their case. Taking away a freedom that has so thoroughly pervaded our lives should involve the democratic process. It shouldn't occur in silence as the result of a thousand small decisions by private firms and bureaucrats. Pass a law. (Or better yet, come and take it.)</p> <p>Third: we currently possess technologies that, properly deployed, maintained and adopted, will substantially restore and protect the right to transact. We should reject attempts, however well-intentioned, to muddy the waters about what cryptocurrency represents at this moment in history. Its drawbacks and growing pains, while real, are more than acceptable in the face of the alternative, which is to embrace our slide into perfect surveillance and financial unfreedom. There is no third option that pleases crypto's critics while preserving even a modicum of the freedom previous generations enjoyed.</p> <p>Starting with number one then:</p> <h2>The freedom to transact is a good thing</h2> <p><em>For if Power without laws, can make laws and change the Fundamentall laws of the Kingdome, I know not what subject in England can be secure of his life, or of any thing which he doth call his own.</em></p> <p>Charles I</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Trying to justify a basic moral truth in abstract terms is usually a bad idea. If personal experience, knowledge of history and a general moral framework can't convince you one way or the other on questions like the freedom of worship or the right to due process, a soup of latinate nouns isn't likely to do the trick.</p> <p>Appeals to empathy may have a better chance of success, but empathy won't spontaneously arise in someone who's lacked it so far. And those who enjoy the good graces of the powers that be – through whatever combination of luck, enthusiasm, docility and compromise – often struggle to imagine themselves at the wrong end of arbitrary power.</p> <p>It's tempting, and perhaps wise, to simply reject the whole exercise. If people truly have a right to transact, say so and leave it at that. Agents and fans of state and corporate power will deny any such right exists, however sublime the arguments in its favor. And people who value individual liberty are likely to agree with the basic position, even if the arguments are nonsense.</p> <p>The authors of the Declaration of Independence didn't tie themselves in philosophical knots over the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They called the whole package 'self-evident' – along with human equality, for good measure – and they moved on.</p> <p>Sadly, I doubt I can get away with the kind of terse moral clarity the American founders used. The fact is that not everyone holds this truth – that all people should be free to transact – to be self-evident. Most people, through no fault of their own, don't know what it would even refer to. <em>What do you mean, who's stopping you?</em></p> <p>As I've argued, the issue hasn't been salient until now, given the capabilities at would-be oppressors' disposal. Cash, the quintessential means of free transaction, remains a fact of daily life. We don't learn in school about some bygone decade's fight to transact freely, because the clash is only beginning – assuming we put up any fight to speak of. The battle lines are mostly alien to the public forum, combining with more familiar fronts in the culture war to form an uncompelling scalene triangle. Accepting or hastening the end of the freedom to transact is, for the moment, the bipartisan default.<sup><a href='#fn12' id='fnref12' epub:type='noteref'>12</a></sup></p> <p>It's also worth noting that the Declaration of Independence didn't instantly end the struggle for basic liberties through the power of stirring language alone. Seven more years of war were necessary to decide this 'self-evident' question.</p> <h3>The right to transact as prerequisite</h3> <p>For the most straightforward and perhaps the most convincing argument I've heard regarding the right to transact, I'm indebted to 6529. I prefer to phrase it in my own words, so please don't attribute any shortcomings in my formulation to him (?), but he deserves the credit for showing me how simple the question really is: once we're denied the right to transact, we're denied every other right by extension.<sup><a href='#fn13' id='fnref13' epub:type='noteref'>13</a></sup></p> <p>The ability to buy and sell things is a prerequisite to rights we already regard as inalienable. Take the right to life: it becomes all but impossible to live when you can't buy food, pay for shelter, or sell goods and labor to obtain money in the first place.</p> <p>A person who isn't allowed to buy or rent a car, or pay for a bus or train ticket, can hardly be said to enjoy liberty. Someone barred from basic participation in the economy can't pursue happiness.</p> <p>Remove the right to transact, and you've in practice trampled on any other civil, human and constitutional right we might care to mention.</p> <p>To be completely clear, I'm not describing a situation of poverty, though that would likely be the ultimate result of the situation I <em>am</em> describing: one in which a person has money, or easily could, but they've been cut off from the system that makes it usable. Their deposits are frozen; their means of sending a payment is disabled; their means of receiving a payment is disabled. </p> <p>I have in mind a situation in which money cannot meaningfully be owned except by its state or private-sector administrators, who grant access to it contingent on whatever criteria they choose.</p> <p>But what would such a world – such a money – look like? That's hard to say definitively, since it's never existed.</p> <h3>A thought experiment</h3> <p>It isn't difficult to imagine, though. Here's a situation that, given the trajectory of technological and political developments, an ordinary person could plausibly experience before the decade is out: without having been charged with any crime, much less convicted of one, she wakes up to find that her digital wallet no longer works.</p> <p>Let's call her Alice.</p> <p>Alice walks into a cafe in the morning, orders a coffee, and taps her phone to pay for it. A peevish vibration alerts her that the transaction has failed. The Federal Reserve wallet app (let's say she's American), containing all of her dollar deposits in the form of a central bank digital currency, has rejected the purchase. She doesn't carry physical cash, because the government no longer issues it or recognizes it as legal tender.</p> <p>She tries again, and the phone buzzes again. An error message on her screen informs her, unhelpfully, that something has gone wrong. She drives to a gas station and the error repeats. She can no longer travel. The grocery store won't take her payment either. A week later, the lights and heat go out. She can't pay her utility bills, or for that matter her rent.</p> <p>If Alice works outside the home, and she can't get to her workplace reliably or at all, she'll lose her job and income. If she works from home, her ability to do so will depend on her having, at a minimum, basic shelter and utilities, and realistically much more than that: the equipment and services she needs to perform her work, even if that's just a laptop with an internet connection.</p> <p>Of course, the question of having what she needs to work might be irrelevant. Let's assume the account freeze hasn't simply prevented Alice from sending money – it's blocked her from receiving it. Even if she could work, she couldn't be paid.</p> <p>A credit card might help fend off the crisis for a few weeks or months, but if her digital dollar wallet remains locked, those bills will go unpaid, and that means of transacting will disappear as well. Nor does it seem likely that the card company would extend credit to someone whose central bank wallet had been shut off.</p> <p>Alice may have no method of finding out why she can't send or receive money. Huge, unaccountable institutions often decline to explain their motives. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that some explanation is provided.</p> <p>What could a satisfactory explanation be? What could justify this treatment?</p> <p>What could Alice have done – or failed to do – such that a constitutional democracy, subject to the rule of law, could countenance this response? Perhaps an especially vicious crime would, set in the scales of justice, balance out this fate more or less. But if Alice were a dangerous criminal, a menace to those around her, the solution wouldn't be to leave her out on the street, free to commit further acts of depraved violence. It would be to incarcerate her.</p> <p>Simply removing Alice's ability to obtain the necessities of life doesn't protect her neighbors. If anything it endangers them more: now she's not just a violent criminal, but a violent criminal deprived of all legal means of getting food and shelter. Nor does the punishment serve to reform or rehabilitate her. There are those who see prison as a barbaric institution to be abolished entirely; somehow I doubt they'd see removal from the economy as a viable alternative.</p> <p>If Alice were a fraudster, a Madoff who'd committed financial crimes, this punishment might have a certain karmic ring to it. But it would be unconstitutional: the Eighth Amendment bars the justice system from imposing ironic sentences like folktale genies.</p> <p>It's difficult to imagine treating someone this way for any reason, which seems to me a serviceable, if inside-out, definition of a right. We would not, for any reason, forbid someone to espouse a particular faith; in other words, we recognize the freedom of worship. We would not strip someone of the ability to use their nation's currency; in other words, we recognize the freedom to transact.</p> <p>It goes without saying that the right to transact doesn't make any given good or service automatically legal to buy or sell. Illegal items and activities would remain illegal. You are not, nor should you be, allowed to possess a collection of potent nerve agents. But we might add, without any contradiction, that it would be absurd to revoke your permission to use money, based on the assumption – however well-founded – that you would use it to buy potent nerve agents.</p> <h3>Terms of service</h3> <p>Such an approach would of course be expedient for law enforcement and financial institutions, but their convenience shouldn't define what a liberal society does and doesn't allow. We can't accept preemptive asset freezing any more than we would accept a person having their right to free speech preemptively revoked, based on the idea – again, however well-founded – that their ravings might give rise to something illegal.</p> <p>And yet making the lives of cops and compliance officers easy is exactly what lies at the root, not just of Alice's hypothetical hell, but of a growing number of real people's (more on that later).</p> <p>There are clear precedents for treating people in similar ways. Social media companies routinely remove content and ban users who engage in perfectly legal, but ugly or inconvenient, speech. Unacceptable as the platforms' behavior may be according to any good-faith interpretation of democratic, constitutional principles, such expedients became the norm in less than a decade.<sup><a href='#fn14' id='fnref14' epub:type='noteref'>14</a></sup> It is convenient for powerful people and wholly satisfactory to powerful political coalitions. Unsurprisingly, no one has stopped it.</p> <p>Returning to the question of what Alice might have done to deserve her fate, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that she somehow violated the Fed's terms of service. We posited that she wasn't charged with a crime. If she had been – or rather, if she'd been convicted – she might justly suffer unpleasant consequences, though summary removal from the economy would be a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.</p> <p>The idea that a court would let a convicted criminal remain physically free, but strip them of the ability legally to obtain basic necessities, is – thankfully – unrealistic. What's depressingly plausible is this scenario: aided by constant surveillance, a bureaucrat or, more likely, an automated system, registers some Suspicious Activity. It expels the person responsible without providing any form of recourse or due process: <em>Your account has been flagged for unusual activity. Please contact our support team to resolve this issue. </em>The support team is an AI chat bot that might as well be a stone wall, and there's no way to speak to a human being.</p> <p>Welcome to the black market.</p> <p>The offenses for which a person might be removed from the payments infrastructure are unlikely to have been clearly enumerated by a democratically elected legislature. More likely they'll be written by employees of a federal agency, or the Federal Reserve, or a private-sector firm to which CBDC development has been contracted out. These rules almost certainly won't be limited in scope or subject to more than symbolic oversight. Rather, they're likely to include the sort of <em>any other unacceptable conduct, as solely determined by us</em> language familiar to the dozen or so people who have actually read a terms of service agreement all the way through.</p> <h3>Ends and means</h3> <p>In some ways the preceding hypothetical is a bit extreme: most likely, relatively few individuals would be totally removed from a CBDC economy. Remove too many people entirely, and the black market will outstrip the approved one.</p> <p>Rather than focus too much on the unfortunate few who would be entirely excommunicated, let's consider the far greater numbers who would be subject to subtler infringements of their freedom.</p> <p>Having lacked the option to instantaneously fine-tune entire populations' access to money, it's hard to say exactly what policymakers would choose to do with this ability. There are no straightforward precedents. Still, it's worth speculating. Sooner or later we'll arrive at a juncture where politicians and bureaucrats do enjoy these capabilities, in some countries if not most, so we should devote some thought to what they might do with them.</p> <p>Presumably, at least in the beginning, they would pursue benign-sounding goals. We can imagine a few possibilities: encouraging healthy, sustainable eating; discouraging drug and alcohol abuse; boosting favored industries; giving historically marginalized groups a leg up; and keeping inflation and unemployment in check.</p> <p>You may find that your spending on fresh produce is subsidized with little discounts to encourage a healthy diet. Same, perhaps, for plant-based meat substitutes. You might find, by contrast, that the five pounds of steak you wanted to buy for a birthday barbecue trigger a penalty, or even rejection: three pounds of red meat is the most you can purchase in a week. Perhaps your third trip to the bar or casino this week similarly fails. Or maybe your phone's accelerometer, GPS and other sensors come to the conclusion that you've been indulging in cocaine again, and it's time to throttle your spending for 36 hours so you can rethink your choices.</p> <p>Perhaps, in line with the Fed's attempts to lower unemployment and raise consistently below-target inflation (those were the days), a negative interest rate has been put in place, with the result that your deposits automatically fall by 0.5% per year.</p> <p>Perhaps, in order to reduce wealth inequality or discourage premature retirement, each dollar saved comes with a 20-year expiration date. </p> <p>Or perhaps a recent 'police-involved shooting' has led to protests in your part of town. Wallets in the area might be frozen until the crowds disperse – or even, to teach the querulous districts a lesson, a bit longer.</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that no one will be entirely free to spend their money on legal goods and services as they please. All money will to some degree resemble food stamps: not a uniform, neutral and universal means of exchange, but a form of coupon subject to complex, changing and humiliating rules. Your purchasing power will be a function of the government's opinion of your decision-making abilities.</p> <p>Unlike food stamps, though, the restrictions need not apply to all recipients in the same way. Favored people will obtain favored objects more easily. Disfavored people will need to justify their choices, and disfavored objects of desire will become harder to obtain. Nothing in principle would stop such restrictions from taking the minutest individual circumstances into account: limits to your freedom to transact could be targeted with the precision of social media ads.</p> <p>This is of course far too much power for anyone to have over the medium of exchange. The state cannot be allowed to intrude into every economic event, however minute, and not just as a spectator, but as the final arbiter of that transaction's acceptability.</p> <p>Before moving on, I should stress that the above – even if it sounds awful – is a relatively optimistic scenario. It's a vision of the sort of bumbling, manageably corrupt, blinkered, corporatized, residually competent state typical of Western democracies circa 2023.</p> <p>But there's no guarantee this situation persists even in the medium term. When a government veers sharply towards totalitarianism of whatever sort – communist, fascist, theocratic or in thrall to some fresh horror – it will enjoy the same fearsome control over payment systems as its on-the-whole democratic predecessor.</p> <p>The ability to interfere with people's freedom to transact, once obtained, will outlast any particular government or form of government. Even if liberal democracy writ large enjoys centuries of continued vigor, a few countries will fall into totalitarianism along the way. Anyone living in a constitutional democracy should hesitate to build a CBDC or any similar system – certainly for their own sakes, but also for their children's.</p> <p>And in any case, such a level of centralized control in itself can't help but alter the basic character of the state. The capabilities of centralized programmable currencies will change constitutional democracy in significant and unpredictable ways, assuming they don't simply destroy it.</p> <h3>Worse-case scenarios </h3> <p>Let's imagine this system in the hands of a more straightforwardly ruthless regime. First, we should acknowledge that the system can be combined with hyper-accurate personal data of any sort: location data, browsing history, social media interactions, calls, texts, medical records, 'smart home' audio recordings, footage from security cameras (equipped with facial recognition), genetic data. All of this data can then be synthesized, organized and interpreted with the aid of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Any government will eventually attempt to bring these methods of surveillance and analysis together into a more or less coherent apparatus. (Success is of course not guaranteed.) But the more straightforwardly power-hungry the state, the more quickly it will do so, and the less compunction it will have about, say, barring you from renting in a certain neighborhood due to the contents of your genome.</p> <p>Dictators have long seized and doled out assets to win support or punish dissent. Equipped with full visibility into and control over transactions, they'll be able to do so with ease and precision. Disfavored groups – be they long-oppressed or former oppressors – could find themselves, if not simply robbed, then fleeced by inflated prices, or barred from obtaining scarce or desirable goods. The malicious logic of the Jim Crow-era shop owner who quotes one price for a white customer and another, higher one for a black customer could be built into the means of exchange itself.</p> <p>Those marginalized by the state could be hemmed into ghettos by geographically delineated permissions to shop, rent, work, or get transportation. Even merchants and landlords who opposed such controls couldn't easily protest them: the transactions would simply fail. Nor does the control of movement need to be purely spatial: leaders will be able to impose targeted lockdowns and curfews using the same means (recall the protesting depositors' surprise covid diagnoses in Henan).</p> <p>And these restrictions could be arbitrarily fine-tuned. Using location data, the screws could be tightened on anyone who's frequented a particular house of worship – or failed to. The criteria for punishment could be anything: having purchased a certain book, downloaded a certain file, visited a certain clinic, immigrated from a certain country, attempted to emigrate to another one, purchased from a certain business – or better yet, failed to. Or it could be a matter of having spoken a bit too freely in the presence of a smartphone microphone.</p> <p>I'm hardly the first one to raise these concerns. Maya Zehavi, an Israeli founder and investor in the cryptocurrency industry, has written: 'The number one reason I'm against CBDC in the surveillance mode BIS is promoting - how my extended family managed to hide away money &amp; gold to survive the ww2 in relative safety. The rising fascism across the world alongside brewing antisemitism means we need to support a web […] For the worst case scenario.'<sup><a href='#fn15' id='fnref15' epub:type='noteref'>15</a></sup> </p> <p>In order to avoid becoming a tool of repression, money needs to remain neutral and portable. Enforcing the law is all well and good. But what if it's against the law to be Jewish, Tutsi, Rohingya, Uyghur? Have modern states demonstrated the wisdom and humanity we'd expect of institutions aspiring to build CBDCs? </p> <p>It's also important to stress that official neglect can be as harmful as official malice. Barring unprecedented feats of conscientiousness and efficiency on the part of the state, there will be many whose remoteness, poverty, lack of education, or mental or physical impairment will prevent them from gaining access to a CBDC in the first place. The state will have no particular quarrel with them – only a measure of contempt, when and if it remembers them. The result will be the same.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, central bankers almost always cite 'financial inclusion' (access to a bank account and a means of payment) as a reason to adopt CBDCs.<sup><a href='#fn16' id='fnref16' epub:type='noteref'>16</a></sup> It's true enough in principle that central banks could offer CBDC access to people who can't open accounts at private-sector banks.</p> <p>But in what world is making the use of currency – in any form – contingent on clearing bureaucratic hurdles like identity verification an <em>improvement</em> on the status quo? As I'll discuss later on, central banks also tout the ability to surveil CBDC usage and root out money laundering and illicit activity as an advantage. To do so, by their own admission, they'd need to tie CBDC accounts to verified, government-issued IDs – exactly what many of today's financially excluded lack.</p> <h3>Monopoly money</h3> <p>Nor will those excluded from the CBDC system, intentionally or not, be able to fall back on legacy forms of payment like cash – at least not legally. For the scheme to even plausibly accomplish policy goals, governments will need to ban physical cash.<sup><a href='#fn17' id='fnref17' epub:type='noteref'>17</a></sup></p> <p>Subsidies, taxes, interest rates, stimulus payments, fines, geographic restrictions, curfews, caps on holdings, expiration dates, surveillance – if alternatives to central bank digital money are allowed to persist, all of these tools lose at least some of their efficacy. Witness European central bankers' anxiety about (metaphorical, mostly) mattresses stuffed with cash, which made passing negative interest rates through to ordinary savers more or less impossible. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Andy Haldane floated a CBDC as a solution to this dilemma in a speech in 2015.<sup><a href='#fn18' id='fnref18' epub:type='noteref'>18</a></sup> </p> <p>Of course, black market means of exchange will emerge. Loopholes and workarounds will be found within the system. Their exact forms will depend on the system's idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities, but they'll certainly make use of combinations of flawed software, gaps in surveillance, and human laziness and corruption.</p> <p>There will also be parallel systems: physical or digital tokens more or less emulating cash will almost certainly circulate, but using them will invite punishment. For an idea of how little sense of humor the state is likely to have regarding alternate payment systems, see its reaction to tax evasion.</p> <h3>Tax evasion, money laundering and crime</h3> <p>Speaking of which, I should address a whole range of criticisms of my position. Collected under one heading, we might say: censorship-resistant, permissionless – in a word 'free' – transactions are, in fact, bad.</p> <p>People who argue the above might cite any combination of the following ills, all of which the freedom to transact does or at least could in principle facilitate: tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, smuggling, bribery, gambling, prostitution, trade in weapons, predatory lending, extortion, and terrorist financing. Apologies if I've forgotten anything: human creativity, in financial wrongdoing as in all things, is boundless.</p> <p>Small-scale tax evasion would certainly become more difficult under a CBDC regime. Cash transactions make underreporting not just easy but, I've heard, tempting. Governments have long managed to collect taxes without the aid of a financial panopticon, though given the tenacity of tax evasion, a certain amount of frustration is understandable.</p> <p>Modern states, more often than not, run grisly deficits, since they fail to tax at a rate anywhere near commensurate with their expenditures. (To do so would, at least in America, probably be impossible.) The incentive to build a system of total financial surveillance and control is clear, but I would argue that we simply can't consider tax evasion sufficient justification for the sort of regime that's being contemplated.</p> <p>After all, the ability to transact freely is nothing new: it's been the default for almost the entire time modern tax regimes have existed. Revenue collection has been imperfect as a result, but even so states have managed – at times – to keep debt within sustainable limits. When fiscal crises have occurred, the culprit has been war, unnecessary infrastructure projects, corruption, outright theft by the regime, or gambling by bankers far more often than it's been an especially tax-averse populace. Even where the tax take is abysmally low, the blame often lies with leaders who purchase political backing through low taxes and lax collection.</p> <p>Ending tax evasion, an unobjectionable goal in the abstract, would not prevent profligate states from spending their way into crisis. Nor would it merit the sacrifices in terms of freedom and human dignity the solution would demand. In any case, the most sophisticated and prolific tax avoiders would pursue technically legal means, the same as they do now. People who use cash to evade taxes hide thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in income; people who use offshore tax havens hide millions or tens of millions.</p> <p>Money laundering is a similar story: in a perfect world, it would be unknown. A perfectly surveilled remote-control currency could conceivably put a stop to criminals' washing their proceeds through cash businesses, since cash wouldn't exist. But the stereotypical picture of money laundering through nail salons, strip clubs, pizza shops, or the classic laundromats – while I have no doubt it occurs – distorts the picture terribly.</p> <p>Industrial-scale money laundering is performed not by these small, more or less seedy, cash-based businesses, but by huge multinational banks. These institutions are already subject to reams of regulation that require reporting and disclosure of 'suspicious' activity. They are as fully deputized to the financial surveillance apparatus as any sector could be, and yet the most cursory glance at their record in combating money laundering yields, well:<br /> </p> <ul> <li>'Wachovia pays $160 million to settle drug money probe' (2010)<sup><a href='#fn19' id='fnref19' epub:type='noteref'>19</a></sup></li> <li>'HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money-Laundering Charges' (2012)<sup><a href='#fn20' id='fnref20' epub:type='noteref'>20</a></sup></li> <li>'Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme' (2019)<sup><a href='#fn21' id='fnref21' epub:type='noteref'>21</a></sup></li> <li>'How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled' (2019)<sup><a href='#fn22' id='fnref22' epub:type='noteref'>22</a></sup></li> <li>'Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn23' id='fnref23' epub:type='noteref'>23</a></sup></li> <li>'Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn24' id='fnref24' epub:type='noteref'>24</a></sup></li> <li>'FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning' (2020)<sup><a href='#fn25' id='fnref25' epub:type='noteref'>25</a></sup></li> <li>'Bank of America insider charged with money laundering for BEC scams' (2021)<sup><a href='#fn26' id='fnref26' epub:type='noteref'>26</a></sup></li> <li>'US families sue Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, accuse them of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan' (2021)<sup><a href='#fn27' id='fnref27' epub:type='noteref'>27</a></sup></li> <li>'Credit Suisse found guilty in cocaine cash laundering case' (2022)<sup><a href='#fn28' id='fnref28' epub:type='noteref'>28</a></sup></li> </ul> <p>It could be argued that these institutions, while subject to extensive and expensive post-9/11 know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, are simply ignoring them, and that imposing surveillance and control at the level of the individual transaction could force compliance.</p> <p>As it turns out, though, the failure isn't the banks' alone. For the most part, they conduct the surveillance required by the American government, filing millions of 'suspicious activity reports' (SARs) with FinCEN, the division of the Treasury Department tasked with combating money laundering, every year. Each SAR filing sets in motion an intricate protocol, as BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported in 2020, whereby the government ignores the reports and … the end.<sup><a href='#fn29' id='fnref29' epub:type='noteref'>29</a></sup></p> <p>According to a 2018 survey by the Bank Policy Institute, less than 4% of SARs 'warranted follow-up inquiries from law enforcement.'<sup><a href='#fn30' id='fnref30' epub:type='noteref'>30</a></sup></p> <p>This hollow ritual allows the banks to 'comply' with regulations by filing the proper forms and, when American regulators say nothing, continue to launder blood money. It allows American bureaucrats and politicians to claim to be fighting terrorists, drug dealers and mobsters. Occasionally, perhaps because a bank has failed to file the proper forms, the bureaucrats impose the sort of fine that banks can easily view as a cost of doing business. These 'enforcement actions' allow the bureaucracy to publish a press release and the politicians to rail against banks, whose campaign contributions they, for the most part, continue to accept.</p> <p>What the ritual does not accomplish is stopping Mexican or Colombian drug cartels, or kleptocrats in Soviet successor states, or jihadist terrorists, or the operators of Ponzi schemes from cleaning their money. The most commonly cited estimate for the effectiveness of global anti-money laundering controls is in the range of 0.1-0.2% – one or two dollars in every thousand.<sup><a href='#fn31' id='fnref31' epub:type='noteref'>31</a></sup> (This statistic also implies that other jurisdictions are no more effective than the U.S. in this regard.)</p> <p>What KYC/AML policies do accomplish is surveillance. FinCEN's 2020 report to Congress, in which it justifies its funding, repeatedly boasts that it has generated millions of reports of cash transactions, which are 'used to identify enforcement and investigative leads as well as strategic trends and patterns.'<sup><a href='#fn32' id='fnref32' epub:type='noteref'>32</a></sup> Plainly, however, money laundering continues apace. The purpose of KYC/AML laws as they exist today is to enhance government surveillance of the financial system.</p> <p>So it's no surprise that money laundering is being used to justify the creation of a system enabling total visibility into the entire field of economic activity: it's an old, successful playbook.</p> <p>Proponents of CBDCs frequently claim that their introduction (and cash's elimination) would solve some of the financial system's most persistent and acute problems. In a paper cited by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution claim that 'the widespread use of CBDC and the obsolescence of paper currency would be helpful in discouraging tax evasion, money laundering, and other illegal activities.'<sup><a href='#fn33' id='fnref33' epub:type='noteref'>33</a></sup></p> <p>The same claim is repeated in almost every favorable discussion of CBDCs, and it is almost certainly false. Particularly in the case of money laundering, policymakers have invoked the modern world's worst boogeymen to justify increasingly invasive scrutiny into individuals' finances. The system fails abjectly at accomplishing its stated goals,<sup><a href='#fn34' id='fnref34' epub:type='noteref'>34</a></sup> but succeeds in gaining visibility into people's transactions – visibility that would be denied under normal constitutional procedures, whereby authorities who want to spy on people need to obtain warrants.</p> <p>In an authoritarian tactic almost too cliché for parody, the state is demanding that we surrender basic freedoms in order to escape suspicion that we're drug dealers or terrorists.</p> <h3>The DMV</h3> <p>Similar logic has become so pervasive in the last couple of decades, it can be difficult to realize how strange and pernicious it really is.</p> <p>So imagine the same way of thinking applied to driving: when you go to the DMV to renew your license, you're handed a tracking device you must attach to your car. Your movements – all of them – are recorded in a DMV database. Any time you drive more than 10 miles, the data from the journey is automatically reported to local, state and federal law enforcement (no need for them to request it, much less obtain a warrant).</p> <p>If you travel more than 50 miles, or travel to a place you haven't been before, or make any stops in an area labeled 'suspicious' – there are many such areas, they change frequently, and you're responsible for knowing where they are – you need to file a Travel Justification Report and submit it to the DMV by fax. Repeated failure to do so could result in fines, suspension of your license, even jail time.</p> <p>It's universally recognized that everyone who drives violates the rules daily. It's wildly impractical to comply with them all, and perhaps, given their complexity and overlap, actually impossible. As a result, you or anyone else could be punished at any time. You have little prospect of defending yourself: of course you've broken the rules, everyone has. The best way to protect yourself is to have friends at the DMV and police precinct.</p> <p>Why are you being subjected to this bureaucratic lunacy? Because organized crime syndicates use roads to transport drugs. Because domestic extremists use roads to transport weapons and carry out terror attacks. Because human traffickers use roads to transport minors for sexual exploitation. What are you suggesting – that none of that <em>matters</em>? </p> <h3>The inevitable hack</h3> <p>I've struggled to find the appropriate place to weave this next point into the argument, so I've left it as an inelegant close to this chapter. Then again, perhaps it makes sense as a jarring coda: in a way, that's what a hack is.</p> <p>Even if every worry I've expressed so far about CBDCs is misplaced, one bad outcome is all but inevitable: a substantial amount of the sensitive, valuable data collected through this new form of money will leak. The government will do its best to avoid a breach, and sooner or later it will fail.</p> <p>Hackers will steal some or all of the transaction data, giving them potent leverage over people in positions of power, as well as countless ordinary people.</p> <p>Likely they'll be state-sponsored (hacking a government is generally not feasible for amateurs). There's precedent: beginning in 2014, Chinese government hackers obtained access to millions of personnel records held by the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management. The data was about as sensitive and valuable as any the state collects: it related to background checks conducted before granting security clearances to federal employees.<sup><a href='#fn35' id='fnref35' epub:type='noteref'>35</a></sup> Such a haul is perfectly suited to facilitating the blackmail of U.S. officials by its most powerful adversary's intelligence agents, and still the government could not protect that information.</p> <p>States should not be able to collect every detail of every payment conducted using their currency – because it's invasive, dangerous and unjust, but also because they can't be trusted to keep the data safe.</p> <p>Nor is a spectacular attack by a rival superpower always necessary to create a breach. In 2018, the Tribune<em> </em>reported that access to Aadhaar, India's universal biometric identification scheme, was on sale to anyone who could pay. The paper's reporters were able to purchase not just the personal details of an individual or some chunk of individuals, but permission to search the entire database, containing highly sensitive information on over a billion people. The price was less than $10.<sup><a href='#fn36' id='fnref36' epub:type='noteref'>36</a></sup></p> <h2>The freedom to transact is disappearing</h2> <p><em>As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.</em></p> <p>Chrystia Freeland</p> <p><br /></p> <p>You might see the previous chapter as overly anxious extrapolation from current trends, if not paranoid fantasy. I'm arguing that we've begun a slide into a state of profound unfreedom, in which the ability to obtain any good or service depends on the whims of the state, which – even if it's benevolent and wise for the moment (it's not) – could easily become uncaring, misguided or actively malicious.</p> <p>But even if you accept that we <em>could</em> slide into such a hell, you probably wish I'd offer some sort of evidence that the slide has begun. A lot of things <em>could </em>happen.</p> <p> Unfortunately, there is ample evidence that business and government leaders intend to introduce fully programmable, remote-control currencies, and to use this technology to pursue policy goals that large constituencies – if not majorities – of the people affected would oppose if given a say. To put it more bluntly: CBDCs are an end run around democratic processes – and potentially, a highly effective one.</p> <p>All the more so because, again unfortunately, the majority of the electorate in the average liberal democracy has little to no idea that such projects are being planned. CBDCs are no secret: I haven't smuggled sensitive documents out of some Washington sub-sub-basement. Central bankers have churned out discussion papers, white papers, proposals and plans related to CBDCs since around 2014,<sup><a href='#fn37' id='fnref37' epub:type='noteref'>37</a></sup> but the audience for this literature is the sort of person who knows what 'FOMC' stands for, what the FOMC does, and most of its members by name. To the vast majority, 'CBDC' is just one more in a sea of wonkish acronyms.</p> <p>Not infrequently, the financial media will report on these central bank publications, but the coverage is for the most part perfunctory and little more than a rewording of central bank statements – sometimes with a nod to abstract Concerns added for balance.</p> <p>Reuters' article on 'digital dollar' pilots announced in 2021 is a model of this sort of coverage: it presents CBDCs as a straightforward modernization project meant to 'improve payment systems' and 'boost financial inclusion'; the notes of caution – the need to protect 'privacy and freedom of commerce' – are provided by the NGO running the pilot and the central bank itself, not critics or even plausibly neutral observers.<sup><a href='#fn38' id='fnref38' epub:type='noteref'>38</a></sup></p> <p>I can only blame the media so much: interest in the topic simply isn't there. It's irrelevant to the culture wars that keep contemporary media in business (which is ironic, given how potent a weapon in those same culture wars CBDCs are likely to become).<sup><a href='#fn39' id='fnref39' epub:type='noteref'>39</a></sup></p> <p>And the source material, unsurprisingly, is sanitary fare. It takes a measure of skepticism and imagination to see how <em>the dollar,<strong> </strong>but digital</em> could empower states in ways they simply shouldn't be empowered. Perhaps, reporters, editors and readers alike could be forgiven for thinking, it takes a bit <em>too</em> much skepticism and imagination.</p> <p>But read the literature closely, and central bankers protest too much, making promises to maintain privacy and neutrality that inspire less confidence every time they're repeated. And sometimes, they make no such promises, laying out plainly how closely they intend to watch individual consumers' most quotidian transactions, and how they intend to censor the ones they deem undesirable.</p> <p>Nor would it be much comfort if central bankers sincerely desired to protect the freedom to transact. (They don't.) If the systems they implement don't enforce such protections at the protocol level – if human decision-making is the only safeguard – then sooner or later the decision-makers will abuse the powers these systems afford them. As Charlie Munger put it, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.</p> <p>For the time being, though, CBDCs remain in the discussion and planning phases. But even in the absence of CBDCs, we're faced with a growing list of concrete examples in which public- and private-sector actors abandon the principle – never so much a principle as the plain fact of a cash-first world – that money is a neutral medium. Private firms have increasingly adopted the view that, even though it violates no law or regulation, a given transaction should be subject to their approval, based on criteria they're free to devise in secret and revise on the fly. Politicians, bureaucrats and activists have encouraged these abuses, pushing firms to limit or revoke their customers' freedom to transact on transparently ideological grounds.</p> <p>CBDCs themselves, in other words, are not the whole issue. They are likely to be developed and adopted, but even if they aren't, powerful actors already possess the willingness and capability to limit the freedom to transact. The following examples deserve our attention because they demonstrate that fact, but also because they demonstrate the motivations, tactics and justifications of the people behind them – people who, if they themselves don't eventually control a CBDC, might inspire those who do.</p> <h3>Canada</h3> <p>In February 2022, in response to protests against covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates that saw truckers blockade economically important southern border crossings, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked a law granting the government sweeping emergency powers.<sup><a href='#fn40' id='fnref40' epub:type='noteref'>40</a></sup> Under this expanded remit, the government froze the financial assets of protesters and required credit card companies and fundraising platforms to report activity related to the protests to anti-money laundering authorities.</p> <p>Standing alongside Trudeau, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Finance, announced these measures at a press conference (emphasis mine):</p> <blockquote> <p>'In invoking the Emergencies Act, we are announcing the following immediate actions. First, we are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use. These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>'The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Our banks and financial institutions are already obligated to report to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FINTRAC.</p> <p>'As of today, all crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use must register with FINTRAC, and they must report large and suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. This will help mitigate the risk that these platforms receive illicit funds, increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC, and make more information available to support investigations by law enforcement into these illegal blockades.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy. The government will also bring forward legislation to provide these authorities to FINTRAC on a permanent basis.</p> <p>'Second, the government is issuing an order with immediate effect under the Emergencies Act authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts.</p> <p>'Third, we are directing Canadian financial institutions to review their relationships with anyone involved in the illegal blockades and report to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] or CSIS [Canadian Security Intelligence Service]. <em>As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.</em><br /> <br /> 'Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades. </p> <p>'This is about following the money. This is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades. We are today serving notice: if your truck is being used in these illegal blockades your corporate accounts will be frozen. The insurance on your vehicle will be suspended. Send your semi-trailers home. The Canadian economy needs them to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer.'<sup><a href='#fn41' id='fnref41' epub:type='noteref'>41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>I hope you'll pardon the long quotation. I see Freeland's address as some of the most valuable primary source material related to the topic of this essay, both because it will be remembered as a turning point in the history of liberal democracies (hopefully in the direction of stronger protections for the right to transact), and because it perfectly captures the rhetoric and mentality of those who support increased surveillance of and control over payments.</p> <p>Freeland presented the government's gathering more data on its citizens' transactions as a good in itself ('increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC'). She presented the new controls as an extension of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules. Since it's difficult to see how the protesters were laundering money (my understanding is that money launderers try to avoid drawing attention to themselves), that leaves two possibilities: the protesters were terrorists (she may in fact have meant to imply this) or, to my mind, the more likely conclusion – that these laws, with their distractingly villainous names, have little to do with terrorists or money laundering, and everything to do with dragnet surveillance.</p> <p>She made no attempt to present these measures as consistent with liberal democratic values, such as the presumption of innocence, the right to free assembly, or limitations on the government's ability to conduct searches and seizures.</p> <p>Instead, she made eight references to 'illegal blockades.' They almost certainly were illegal: civil disobedience is illegal by definition. But beyond that, there are limits to what any state or society can tolerate from its protesters, and the truckers may indeed have exceeded those limits. It's not my place to say. What I want to stress is that no court heard evidence regarding these protests or ruled them illegal. The laws they were accused of violating weren't specified. In the space of five minutes, a government minister declared the protesters' actions illegal; unveiled a new, unprecedented punishment for their crimes; and deputized private sector firms to root out and punish the perpetrators.</p> <p>Nor was it an idle threat. A week into the state of emergency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that they had frozen 219 financial products, as well as 3.8 million Canadian dollars held by a payment processor. (By that time, according to the government, the process of unfreezing assets had begun.)<sup><a href='#fn42' id='fnref42' epub:type='noteref'>42</a></sup></p> <p>Canada's actions have no antecedent that I'm aware of in modern liberal democracies, but even so they elicited muted criticism. Mainstream outlets, at least in the U.S., paid little attention to this innovation in the maintenance of public order: using information obtained through warrantless surveillance of the financial system to cut off protesters' access to credit cards and bank accounts.</p> <p>The lack of any official condemnation from other Western governments suggests they might at least consider pursuing similar measures to break up protests against their own policies. To state the obvious, there is no guarantee that such weaponization of the financial system will be limited to left-of-center governments like Trudeau's, or its victims to those aligned with the political right. Once these tools become available to them, governments of any persuasion will gladly use them against protesters of any description.</p> <p>Canadians will almost certainly hesitate to attend protests critical of the government from now on, since they know that they can be arrested and denied the means to pay bail – indeed, pay for anything. Their right to free assembly has been effectively eliminated, without any need to pass a law or create a spectacle through physical confrontations. </p> <p>The people of other ostensibly liberal democracies might soon experience the same chilling effect, to the extent they haven't already, having seen Canada's example.</p> <h3>PayPal</h3> <p>Often, financial services providers are happy to surveil and punish their customers for the sorts of infractions the Canadian authorities went after, but without any prompting from the government. (At least, any public prompting.)</p> <p>PayPal, a private payment processor, has for years enforced an idiosyncratic moral code based not on the laws of any jurisdiction it happens to operate in, but its own opaque Terms of Service regime.</p> <p>In 2020, Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director at the non-profit crypto advocacy group Coin Center, compiled a list of examples in which PayPal barred users from its platform for engaging in perfectly legal activity: OnlyFans models were prohibited from selling nude photos on the platform; independent journalists tracking the spread of covid in prisons were kicked off when Twitter flagged them for spreading misinformation; a website publishing files for 3D printing guns (protected speech) and selling related merch was banned (their Twitter account is also suspended).<sup><a href='#fn43' id='fnref43' epub:type='noteref'>43</a></sup> </p> <p>The ACLU has criticized PayPal for barring sex workers.<sup><a href='#fn44' id='fnref44' epub:type='noteref'>44</a></sup> The company was accused of stalling efforts to raise bail money for Black Lives Matter protesters.<sup><a href='#fn45' id='fnref45' epub:type='noteref'>45</a></sup> It shut a user out for making payments related to Tor nodes he was hosting.<sup><a href='#fn46' id='fnref46' epub:type='noteref'>46</a></sup> A Canadian news outlet's payment for an article about Syrian refugees was blocked – apparently for mentioning the word 'Syria.'<sup><a href='#fn47' id='fnref47' epub:type='noteref'>47</a></sup> PayPal froze WikiLeaks' account in 2010.<sup><a href='#fn48' id='fnref48' epub:type='noteref'>48</a></sup></p> <p>Recently, the company went beyond keeping users' funds in limbo, and signaled its intention to actually seize money from users who fall afoul of its rules.</p> <p>In October 2022 PayPal said it would levy steep fines for a range of activities, including speech the company deemed unacceptable.<sup><a href='#fn49' id='fnref49' epub:type='noteref'>49</a></sup> The language of the updated 'Acceptable Use Policy,' which would have gone into force the following month, labeled the 'sending, posting, or publication of messages, content, or materials that meet certain criteria' as 'prohibited activities' that could result in fines of $2,500. Among these 'certain criteria' was content found to 'promote misinformation.'</p> <p>A company whose purpose – at least in its customers' eyes – is to process payments, has taken upon itself the duty to monitor its customers' speech, judge that speech's merits according to criteria known to no one outside the company (in all likelihood, never explicitly defined anywhere), and if the speech is found wanting, seize its customers' funds as punishment.</p> <p>To be clear, the procedure envisioned in this document wasn't to freeze funds or bar access to the platform. PayPal would have gone beyond even Canada's emergency measures and permanently confiscated its customers' money. (The document was pulled from PayPal's website, and the company claimed the proposed change was an 'error.')</p> <p>If a state took these actions, we would be rightly outraged, but hardly surprised. Monarchs, emperors, high priests, generals and the like have all too frequently done this sort of thing. In enforcing their vision of truth, they've used economic measures along with other, grislier tactics. One could name any number of examples from any number of places, going back as far as recorded history permits.</p> <p>For a private company to adopt this attitude, though, is strange. Having your assets confiscated for heresy is one thing, if the Church or King is doing it. If a democracy is doing it, you might (but shouldn't) comfort yourself with the notion that at least the censorship is of, by and for the people. For an online payments service to act this way, though, is something else entirely. PayPal is not a democratically accountable institution. Nor does any sort of social contract exist that could conceivably give it the right to punish crimes of conscience.</p> <p>The situation is just silly. PayPal isn't yet 30 years old. It has 'pal' in the name. For an institution of this type to freelance as Ministry of Truth would be a farce, except that it's part of a definite trend: Facebook, Google and Twitter have taken it upon themselves to determine – according to inconsistent, flighty standards that make scant reference to constitutional principles – what may and may not be said.</p> <h3>Third parties</h3> <p>Why should these companies be empowered to enforce a superset of the law? It seems law enforcement bodies themselves have provided some of the impetus.</p> <p>Cops in constitutional democracies are in theory constrained by protections like the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure. But American authorities, at least, have a convenient way around these hurdles: once a person voluntarily provides a third party with information (the way PayPal's customers provide it with their payments data), constitutional strictures fall away. Law enforcement can simply ask the company for the data, with no need to seek a search warrant from a court.</p> <p>The company could refuse, of course, in which case the authorities are back to petitioning judges through the normal procedure envisioned in the Bill of Rights. But from the perspective of a heavily regulated financial services company, how is it in your interest to stand up for your customers' rights? The politicians and regulators who can make or break your thin margins with a couple well-aimed laws or rules don't, with rare exceptions, care about your customers' privacy. They actively resent it, to the extent it makes catching criminals, terrorists and 'extremists' – a term that tends to cover the whole of the political opposition – more difficult.</p> <p>One might expect voters to enforce a concern for constitutional protections by electing lawmakers who care about such protections: after all, these voters are almost all customers of one or more financial services firms. But by and large, the electorate doesn't care either. They too would like to catch criminals, terrorists and extremists, and this is a perfectly healthy instinct.</p> <p><em>If you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide</em>, authoritarian politicians argue, and in the main, voters agree. This logic presupposes, however, a reasonable and humane definition of 'wrong.' Practically everyone in a modern democratic society qualifies as a criminal and extremist by the standards of the sort of authoritarian regime that governed broad swathes of the globe in the 20th century.</p> <p>Considering voters' (and customers') indifference to cooperation between law enforcement and data-rich financial service providers, the clear interest law enforcement has in cultivating such cooperation, and the regulatory hostility companies can expect if they resist, it's hardly surprising that PayPal should volunteer to enforce not just the law, but the preferences of government officials.</p> <p>PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy reads as if the company has been deputized by the authorities to enforce the laws they wish existed, as well as the ones that actually do. Item one under the heading 'Prohibited Activities' covers those that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Fair enough. There then follow a couple dozen <em>other</em> prohibited activities and yet more which require pre-approval.<sup><a href='#fn50' id='fnref50' epub:type='noteref'>50</a></sup> </p> <p>The obvious question is not addressed: why should PayPal restrict payments for legal goods and services – even 'items that are considered obscene?'</p> <p>Of course as a private company they're within their rights to do so. Customers can take their business elsewhere, the logic runs. But when most if not all financial services providers are similarly cowed into acting as freelance police, what is the alternative?<br /> <br /> It's also worth interrogating the justification for companies behaving this way: they're private, true, but they're also some of the most heavily regulated firms in the private sector. Legislators and bureaucrats have long felt comfortable placing significant constraints on these companies' behavior. They could, I imagine, mandate that firms only censor transactions when actual laws are being violated, but they don't. </p> <p>The result is a system that enables enforcement without legislation. A legal but <em>obscene</em> activity rubs law enforcement the wrong way. It is made known that payments related to such activities are <em>risky</em> for firms to process, so they don't. Replicated across the economy, this cycle creates de facto law without the need for democratic debate, legislative process or judicial scrutiny. These pseudo-laws can't be challenged or repealed – or even, usually, read. They are codified, if at all, through vague, sweeping references in terms of service agreements that can change at any time without notice. </p> <p>The victims of this system are the small but growing class of 'debanked' people, who almost never find out why their bank – sometimes multiple banks – have severed ties with them. One day their cards stop working, they slog through their bank's customer service morass, and in the end they still have no idea why they've been deemed unworthy of an account.</p> <p>In 2023, Naafeh Dhillon told the New York Times that his card was rejected one evening, and all Chase would tell him was that 'unexpected activity' had led to all of his accounts being closed.<sup><a href='#fn51' id='fnref51' epub:type='noteref'>51</a></sup> 'I received no kind of warning or red flag,' Dhillon said. (Money sent by his Pakistani parents while he was in college was put forward as a potential culprit.)</p> <p>Another Chase customer said he'd been unable to find out why he was dropped as a customer even after three years. </p> <p>A Synchrony customer told the paper that his funds had been frozen because – he was able to wring the reason from the bank – of an out-of-state attempt to log into his account. He made the attempt; he was traveling.</p> <p>Recall Alice, the hypothetical CBDC user I invented to illustrate the horror of being locked out of using one's national currency. Her money became unavailable one day, and she had no means of finding out why or reversing the decision. This sort of thing happens today, and appears to be happening more often.</p> <p>Lawyers write expansive, moralizing terms of service that allow for the removal of any even remotely <em>risky</em> customer. Programmers and – to the extent AI is involved in the process, programs – translate these rules into automated systems that comb customer data for <em>unexpected activity</em>. Law enforcement, as I mentioned above, is only remotely interested in perhaps 4% of these alerts, but there's no question of letting the justice system sort out who's guilty of wrongdoing. Anyone the banks remotely suspect of anything, they simply kick out. Why take the risk?<br /> <br /> There's no reason to expect CBDCs to operate differently. Who will build the compliance and risk management systems, after all, if not the people who built them for the banks? The only difference will be that when the central bank debanks people, they'll have no legal way to buy or sell anything. </p> <h3>The misinformation hunt</h3> <p>A trend that, for the time being, is mostly unrelated to the financial sector provides a compelling reason to worry about the freedom to transact.</p> <p>The past decade has seen the emergence of concerted activist efforts aimed at technology companies, originating from within their ranks as well as outside – from NGOs, universities, and the government. The details of the agenda – which is far from unified – change frequently, and often on a dime, but 'progressive' is the label activists generally use, and anyone passingly familiar with the political discourse knows more or less what that term indicates in a given moment.</p> <p>Progressive campaigns have focused most heavily on social media companies, where the goal is to 'deplatform' – that is, censor – unacceptable speech. Such speech includes racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry, with the crucial caveat that such labels are applied with shocking liberality: statements that would have occasioned no remark in the most progressive circles five or ten years ago frequently meet with shrieking denunciations today. Even inaction, declining to join in the denunciations or to express full-throated support for any number of mercurial shibboleths raises hackles. <em>Silence</em>, a common slogan has it, <em>is violence.</em><br /> <br /> And if silence is violence, so of course is speech. And if dissent of either sort – spoken or tacit – is violence, it must be stopped by any means necessary, including real, physical violence. Once this line of thinking is pursued to its logical extreme, the usual brakes on censorship are easily dismissed as irrelevant, absurd – even, through a neat trick whereby the people stripping civil rights from their political enemies become the victims, <em>fascist</em>. </p> <p>Practically all of the speech the deplatformers would silence enjoys First Amendment protection. They bat away that objection. Much of the speech is factually accurate, and the deplatformers know that. No matter. If it doesn't conform to their ideological requirements, it is violence, or if that label doesn't fit, <em>misinformation</em> (also, <em>disinformation</em>).<sup><a href='#fn52' id='fnref52' epub:type='noteref'>52</a></sup> </p> <p>It has proven not just possible, but trivial, to censor disfavored voices with little to no justification beyond the invocation of that single word – <em>misinformation – </em>despite all the constitutional protections we might reasonably expect to stand in the way.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this expedient has proven popular not just with activists, but politicians, bureaucrats and law enforcement.</p> <p>The Twitter Files, published in 2023 by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, have revealed that those engaged in the fight against bad speech often acknowledge privately that the posts they are censoring are factual (misinformation that's accurate has been given a special designation by censorship practitioners: <em>malinformation</em>).<sup><a href='#fn53' id='fnref53' epub:type='noteref'>53</a></sup> They justify their inventions based on the risk that the facts could 'exacerbate distrust' in people and institutions they wish to defend.<sup><a href='#fn54' id='fnref54' epub:type='noteref'>54</a></sup> </p> <p>Perhaps more important is who<em> </em>these misinformation fighters are. A few years ago, it was reasonable to assume that social media censorship was carried out by employees of the platforms due to pressure from, or sympathy with, activists.</p> <p>The Twitter Files have exposed that assumption as hopelessly naïve. They have demonstrated active collaboration between employees of every major social media platform;<sup><a href='#fn55' id='fnref55' epub:type='noteref'>55</a></sup> universities including Stanford and NYU; the National Conference on Citizenship, a federally chartered non-profit; and the Centers for Disease Control. Among the sources of funding for the partners involved in one such program – called the Virality Project, its focus was removing disfavored speech related to covid – are the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation.</p> <p>Participants in this effort called for (and obtained) the creation of a 'Disinformation Governance Board' within the Department of Homeland Security. Calling this body a 'Ministry of Truth' or some other Orwellian label doesn't really enhance the impact: its real name is already apex-Orwellian.<sup><a href='#fn56' id='fnref56' epub:type='noteref'>56</a></sup></p> <p>Other revelations in the Twitter Files detail cooperation between Twitter employees and the FBI, as well as the White House. The company repeatedly acceded to requests from these entities to censor legal speech, including speech related to the 2020 presidential election.<sup><a href='#fn57' id='fnref57' epub:type='noteref'>57</a></sup></p> <p>Another source of insight into government censorship of social media is <em>Missouri v. Biden</em>, a lawsuit brought by that state's attorney general, together with other plaintiffs, against the Biden administration. The discovery process in that suit has unearthed extensive evidence of First Amendment violations by the federal bureaucracy, much of it overlapping with the content of the Twitter files.<sup><a href='#fn58' id='fnref58' epub:type='noteref'>58</a></sup></p> <p>A few details add color to the overall picture: the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acted as a 'switchboard' for the censorship efforts of several executive departments, facilitating meetings that included 'DHS, FBI, U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Microsoft, and Verizon Media.'<br /> <br /> The head of CISA, justifying the agency's role in coordinating censorship, argued that its mandate to protect infrastructure includes 'cognitive infrastructure' – that is, speech – and that 'it's really, really dangerous if people get to pick their own facts.' (The government, presumably, should be the sole arbiter of what is true.) </p> <p>The plaintiffs note that the Census Bureau and the Treasury Department were also involved in flagging so-called misinformation to remove from social media sites. The Treasury's efforts, according to DHS documents, focused on 'public confidence' in the financial system. (I'm willing to bet that the contents of this essay constitute misinformation according to the standards of the Treasury's inquisitors.)<br /> <br /> The Virality Project, mentioned above, 'provided strategic insights to government entities such as the OSG [Office of the Surgeon General], CDC, and the Department of Health and Human Services,' according to the complaint. The OSG in particular pressured Facebook and other social media companies to remove content related to covid. </p> <p>The suit also details the government's coordination with platforms to remove election-related posts. Much of this was conducted through the Election Integrity Partnership, a Stanford-affiliated 'non-partisan coalition' that makes no mention, at least publicly, of having been set up by CISA. (According to the complaint, this is 'simply another moniker' for the Virality Project; both refer to the same teams engaged in the same activities.)</p> <p>To be clear: the executive branch, overseen by the president, created an organization to censor content related to presidential elections.</p> <p>Elections being the main constitutional means of replacing the president and preventing him or her from staying on for life, I'd argue that people holding that office shouldn't be allowed to dictate what can and can't be said about elections. The fact that the effort was presented as purely academic and unaffiliated with the government is all the more galling.</p> <p>What could justify such antidemocratic behavior on the part of the government? They were putting a stop to violence of course. Except this violence, like so much of the 'violence' people are accused of these days, was simply to speech – or more precisely, hesitance to curtail others' speech. In July 2021, Biden publicly accused platforms of 'killing people' by allowing users to post alleged misinformation related to covid. Shortly thereafter the White House threatened to revisit legislation exempting platforms from legal liability for information users post there. Social media companies responded with a flurry of activity, reviewing or taking down posts and accounts the government had (privately) expressed distaste for.</p> <p>The plaintiffs in the suit also note that the government has moved beyond policing election- and covid-related posts, branching into 'climate change, 'gendered disinformation,' abortion and economic policy' as well as 'racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.'</p> <p>No single thread runs through all of these topics, except current-year partisan politics, meaning in essence that the White House feels at liberty to order the removal of any content from any social media platform, so long as it disagrees with the political stance of the content.</p> <p>We're presented with further evidence that misinformation – as a non-<em>expert</em> might describe it – is not the real concern. Facebook's parent company Meta (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) reassured the White House that it will target 'non-violative content, such as discussing the choice to vaccinate in terms of personal or civil liberties.' The factuality – forget the constitutionally protected status – of the content is not considered important; rather the acceptable line has been laid down (<em>vaccines are safe and effective</em>) and any challenge to that line, even if grounded in reality, must be removed.</p> <p>And just to emphasize something that's easy to miss in the foregoing: discussions of civil liberties were explicitly singled out for removal, itself a violation of civil liberties.</p> <p>A coordinated censorship campaign embracing social media companies, numerous government agencies, universities, law enforcement bodies, NGOs, the military, the White House, and miscellaneous activists already exists. Its participants are pleased with their success so far in curtailing constitutionally protected expression and plan to expand their efforts to any topic they deem politically salient, not stopping at elections themselves.</p> <p>It would be appealing and no doubt rather simple for the censors to expand along another axis, from social media platforms into payment systems. As Taibbi noted in a statement delivered to Congress, 'ordinary Americans are not just being reported to Twitter for 'deamplification' or de-platforming, but to firms like PayPal [...] and crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.'<sup><a href='#fn59' id='fnref59' epub:type='noteref'>59</a></sup></p> <p>The financial services sector is joining the misinformation crusade.</p> <h3>JPMorgan Chase</h3> <p>Ignoring Canada, banks don't yet condition their services on customers' holding acceptable views, at least to my knowledge.<sup><a href='#fn60' id='fnref60' epub:type='noteref'>60</a></sup> There appears to have been a high-profile exception to the rule, however, and it could be a sign of things to come.</p> <p>JPMorgan Chase closed Kanye 'Ye' West's accounts after the artist made a string of explicitly antisemitic comments in the fall of 2022.<sup><a href='#fn61' id='fnref61' epub:type='noteref'>61</a></sup> West's rhetoric – including a threat to go 'death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE' – escalated in the weeks following his bank's decision to cut ties, and before long he was publicly indulging in unambiguous praise for Hitler.</p> <p>If there were ever speech that merited ejection from the financial system, I suppose this would be it. It is cartoonishly villainous to glorify one of history's greatest mass murderers and menace one of the communities he singled out for physical extermination. But accepting such a premise – that access to banking is subject to an ideological test of any sort – is fundamentally illiberal, and down the line it poses a greater threat to freedom and justice than some obviously unwell celebrity's embrace of Nazism.</p> <p>Now JPMorgan Chase, to my knowledge, is at perfect liberty, legally speaking, to end its relationship with Ye for this or any number of reasons. (Nor, to my knowledge, is there any proof that Ye's comments were the reason for the bank's decision.)</p> <p>But as with PayPal, such decisions set a precedent that withholding the ability to transact is an effective and convenient means of social control. It's difficult to argue that the people running a private business – bank executives, say – should be compelled to provide services to someone they don't want as a customer. They should enjoy their own freedoms, after all.</p> <p>But in the realm of finance and payments, the line between the state and private business breaks down before it's even drawn. Personnel move freely between Wall Street C-suites and the Treasury, along with any number of ministries of finance and financial regulatory bodies around the world. Just 15 years ago, American taxpayers bailed out the world's largest banks. A century before that, the country's richest bankers bailed out the American government.</p> <p>It's far from surprising that when Canada ordered banks to summarily freeze the accounts of anti-lockdown protesters, the banks complied without a (public) word of complaint.</p> <p>Nor is it surprising that PayPal acts as freelance private-sector law enforcement, doing its best to crack down on activities without asking the government to trouble itself with obtaining warrants or even making specific requests. Often enough, the activities aren't illegal, so law enforcement would have little hope of following the constitutionally prescribed procedure.</p> <p>Returning to Ye, though: should we shed a tear for the man in a ski mask extolling Hitler's contributions to civilization?<sup><a href='#fn62' id='fnref62' epub:type='noteref'>62</a></sup> I don't plan to, but nor should we let contempt for this specific individual cloud our vision of the principles at stake. If only people who sank to such a level were targeted for financial exclusion, I doubt much practical damage would result. The world might even marginally improve.</p> <p>But authoritarian overreach often targets the least sympathetic figures first, then, once it's gained momentum, moves towards the center. The 18th-century French revolutionaries began by defining an aristocrat as French society always had: a titular member of the nobility, recognized as such by clergy, commoners and other aristocrats alike. Many of the revolutionaries being aristocrats themselves, they weren't generally bent on killing the whole caste.</p> <p>Within a few years, however, an 'aristocrat' could be anyone, commoner, noble or priest, unfortunate enough to fall foul of the mob. The virtuous revolutionary 'citizen' denouncing this aristocrat could be a member of the nobility who had renounced their title.<sup><a href='#fn63' id='fnref63' epub:type='noteref'>63</a></sup> 'Aristocrat' was simply shorthand for a counterrevolutionary, a heretic. To be labeled one was to be one – no daylight shone between accusation and conviction – and to be one was to deserve death.</p> <p>We might consider the case of Ye's interviewer in the ski mask incident, who practically pleaded with the artist to express at least some reservation regarding the Third Reich. Alex Jones is not generally known as a voice of reason. He is notorious for a years-long campaign meant to discredit and torment – of all people – the parents of victims of an elementary school shooting. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly then, when Jones was removed from all major internet platforms in 2018,<sup><a href='#fn64' id='fnref64' epub:type='noteref'>64</a></sup> words of protest were few and far between. Who could regard the slippery slope of censorship with such dread that they'd defend the Sandy Hook truther?</p> <p>But there were those who warned that the same fate would befall more and more people, for less and less heinous speech, and they were correct.<sup><a href='#fn65' id='fnref65' epub:type='noteref'>65</a></sup> Today people are routinely removed from social platforms for posting 'misinformation.' As noted above, in many if not most cases, this speech is a matter of opinion, and in a sizable minority of cases, the 'misinformation' is factually correct, but considered somehow unseemly.</p> <p>Debates over the effectiveness of covid vaccines brought many such cases to light. As Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023:</p> <blockquote> <p>'take some of the stuff around covid earlier on in the pandemic, where there were real health implications, but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions, and unfortunately I think a lot of the kind of establishment on that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true.'<sup><a href='#fn66' id='fnref66' epub:type='noteref'>66</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>It's not necessary, however, to make analogies to social media platforms to argue that financial deplatforming will hit a slippery slope. PayPal started sloping long ago, moving from policing sex work to policing speech.</p> <h3>Guns, porn and abortion</h3> <p>The reasons behind PayPal or JPMorgan's actions can be guessed at, but the conversations that precipitated them are opaque and will probably stay that way. In some cases, though, financial deplatforming – or steps in that direction – are clearly the result of long and targeted activist campaigns.</p> <p>In September 2022, Visa, Amex and Mastercard agreed to categorize gun sales differently from other 'general merchandise' purchases, the category under which such sales previously fell.</p> <p>This added surveillance allows credit card companies to 'flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammunition are sold,' according to the Associated Press, which described the development as a 'significant win' for gun control advocates.<sup><a href='#fn67' id='fnref67' epub:type='noteref'>67</a></sup></p> <p>To state the obvious, these activists aren't elected, so they can't be removed from office by voters. They aren't businesses, so they can't be pushed to change course by customers (though customers can and should punish the businesses that cave to such activists' demands).</p> <p>These groups aren't directly accountable to ordinary people who need to make and receive payments, yet they're able to constrain these people's freedom to transact. They do so in order to make it more difficult to engage in legal activities that, in the activists' opinion, shouldn't be legal. Rather than accept the outcome of the democratic process and continue campaigning for stricter gun control, such groups enforce their preferred version of the law by lobbying for changes to the internal processes of financial platforms: legislation by other means.</p> <p>Given the success of this technique, it's a matter of time before pressure groups subject a wider range of legal purchases to added scrutiny, without the hassle of winning elections and passing laws.</p> <p>The editor of a Catholic news outlet spoke to Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in 2023, pressing him to consider whether the company was 'funding' the sexual exploitation of minors by processing users' payments to PornHub.<sup><a href='#fn68' id='fnref68' epub:type='noteref'>68</a></sup></p> <p>Pro-choice activists have expressed justifiable concerns that opponents of abortion, another politically charged issue, are likely to seek out payments data in order to punish women who obtain the procedure. In 2022, after decades of campaigning on the issue and pushing for the nomination of Supreme Court justices who would overturn a 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, pro-life activists managed to ban it outright in several U.S. states.<sup><a href='#fn69' id='fnref69' epub:type='noteref'>69</a></sup> </p> <p>Women in these places are able to travel to other states to have the procedure (though in practice this isn't always feasible), and some advocates of the ban wish to prosecute those who do so. Payments data is a convenient way to gather evidence for such prosecutions.</p> <p>Contacted by the New York Times, few payments providers would say what they would do in response to subpoenas from, say, Texas authorities seeking information on a woman's financial activity. Experts interviewed by the paper pointed out that courts could potentially order companies to turn the data over, as well as issuing gag orders to prevent them from alerting the woman alleged to have sought the abortion. She in turn could face jail time.<sup><a href='#fn70' id='fnref70' epub:type='noteref'>70</a></sup></p> <p>Explaining the precedents for such subpoenas, the Times wrote, 'Card issuers have grown used to requests for user data in terrorism, money-laundering and illegal-trafficking investigations.' The slope slippens.</p> <h3>The war on cash</h3> <p>Of course, the authorities' and activists' ability to exploit payment rails as a chokepoint goes out the window if people simply pay cash. Unsurprisingly, then, the state is making efforts to curtail its use. It's common to hear politicians and policy wonks disparage the evils of 'dirty' paper money: dirty both in the literal sense, of germ-carrying bills, and more importantly in the figurative sense, of filthy lucre obtained illicitly.</p> <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetization of large rupee notes in 2016 had the stated aim of flushing 'black money' out of the economy and moving towards a 'cashless society.'<sup><a href='#fn71' id='fnref71' epub:type='noteref'>71</a></sup> The move caused immense disruption, forcing millions to line up outside of banks and ATMs (over a hundred people reportedly died in these lines). What it did not do was eliminate cash or leave the beneficiaries of crime and corruption stranded: essentially all demonetized notes were exchanged, so 99.3% of the dirty money blighting the Indian economy before demonetization continued to circulate afterwards.<sup><a href='#fn72' id='fnref72' epub:type='noteref'>72</a></sup></p> <p>It's common to envision a near future in which cash has been eliminated entirely, but that's not to say it's an edgy or futuristic vision: people simply assume at some level that cash's time is limited. What use, outside of crime, could grubby paper notes have in an otherwise digital world?</p> <p>While it's possible that these assumptions are the natural product of the internet and smartphones, we can't be sure, because we can't ignore the effect of decades of legislation aimed at limiting the use of cash to small, everyday transactions.</p> <p>In a piece published by Coin Center, University of Virginia Law School adjunct professor Abraham Sutherland details the history, effects and intention of the law's most powerful disincentive against the use of cash: section 6050I of the U.S. tax code, passed in 1984.<sup><a href='#fn73' id='fnref73' epub:type='noteref'>73</a></sup></p> <p>Today, Sutherland writes, due to this provision and its subsequent expansions and revisions, 'if you use large amounts of physical currency, there's something wrong with you, and it's probably that you're a criminal. It's such a legally fraught hassle that there's no other explanation.'</p> <p>In 1970, in an effort to combat or be seen to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, banks were required to report cash transactions over $10,000, the equivalent of $65,000 today. In 1984, anyone performing commercial transactions was required to report similarly sized transactions by the passage of section 6050I. This allowed law enforcement to go after drug dealers for failure to report cash income, particularly after 1988, when violations were upgraded to felonies. (According to Sutherland, this is the only information reporting requirement carrying felony penalties.)</p> <p>This change to tax law massively enhanced the state's capacity for financial surveillance. Whatever its intended purpose, this has become the law's most consequential effect, and the state has strengthened the statute in order to enhance this capacity further.</p> <p>The reporting requirement has become a window, easily available to law enforcement of any description, into the financial lives of Americans. Any cash transaction of more-than-quotidian importance now must be shared with the tax authorities, who of course are normally barred from violating taxpayers' confidentiality. But the exception to this rule, passed by Congress in 1988, is Form 8300, the form the IRS requires anyone receiving $10,000 or more to file.</p> <p>The Treasury can share your Form 8300 with employees of any federal agency or, as of 1996, any agency of any state or local – even foreign – government. Nor do these lax controls actually limit how widely cash transaction data can be shared: in 2001, Congress copy-pasted the text of 6050I into the Bank Secrecy Act, requiring the same information be shared with FinCEN, who can then treat it with even less regard for privacy than the IRS does.</p> <p>Cash transaction reporting requirements militate against the logic of normal commerce. To accept, say, $20,000 in cash in exchange for some good or service requires a seller to verify their counterparty's government ID, obtain their Social Security number and date of birth, record their occupation, and describe the transaction. The seller then signs the form under penalty of perjury and mails it to the IRS in at most 15 days. Failure to meet this high bar of peer-to-peer surveillance on behalf of the government can result in a $25,000 fine or five years in prison.</p> <p>Sutherland depicts what navigating it routinely might be like for a law-abiding business owner who wants to deal in cash. I suggest reading it; it's maddening. His point, though, is that such business owners are hypothetical. They do not and cannot exist, because at some point, they must give up on either cash or compliance. So cash is in practice an illegal medium of payment for businesses, unless they limit themselves to accepting it from customers in small amounts – the way a restaurant might – and immediately depositing it to a bank account.</p> <p>This burdensome process encourages anyone not dealing in organs harvested from the living to simply use banks. But the process reveals something about the role of banks, at least from the government's perspective: the high-fidelity surveillance that merchants are required to perform on their counterparties is simply the level of surveillance the state can expect its compliant financial sector to perform on its behalf. Banks are an extension of law enforcement.</p> <p>By making banks mandatory for businesses that wish to operate legally, the tax authorities assure they don't miss out on too many revenue-raising opportunities, and law enforcement enjoys a detailed view into ordinary people's financial dealings, without the hassle of petitioning courts for warrants.</p> <p>With the introduction of cash-like payment apps, the effort to surveil all possible transactions has expanded. The IRS now requires platforms such as Venmo and PayPal to report commercial payments totalling over $600 per year.<sup><a href='#fn74' id='fnref74' epub:type='noteref'>74</a></sup> The previous requirement was to report payments numbering 200 or more and totalling over $20,000. As inflation – which is touching multi-decade highs at the time of writing – does its work, this threshold decreases in real terms until, in a few years, any but the tiniest purchases must legally be disclosed to the government. </p> <p>The Netherlands has proposed a law that would lower the threshold to €100.<sup><a href='#fn75' id='fnref75' epub:type='noteref'>75</a></sup> The European Central Bank has stopped producing €500 notes. Justifications for this move in the press generally invoked the worst boogeymen of our era: jihadists, drug cartels and organized crime.<sup><a href='#fn76' id='fnref76' epub:type='noteref'>76</a></sup></p> <p>And yet the change arose not with any noticeable surge in the activity of any of these actors, but with a failure to square a policy circle: desiring to implement negative interest rates (the historically unprecedented practice of borrowers charging lenders interest), policymakers realized that rather than watch their bank deposits erode, savers would simply withdraw cash. What better way to prevent that outcome than to accuse aggrieved savers of consorting with society's worst villains?</p> <p>Businesses that deal in large amounts of cash – or rather, that might otherwise deal in large amounts of cash – find themselves saddled with so much paperwork and subject to such scrutiny and suspicion, that the state's hostility to this least-surveillable form of money is clear.</p> <p>In Europe and North America, the vice is tightening slowly. It is becoming idiosyncratic and inconvenient to spend more than a couple hundred dollars' worth of cash at a time, but the authorities have not gone so far as to actively clamp down on its use.<sup><a href='#fn77' id='fnref77' epub:type='noteref'>77</a></sup> </p> <h3>The exception that proves the rule</h3> <p>I've argued that even the most authoritarian regimes haven't historically contemplated enforcing ideological and behavioral conformity through the surveillance and censorship of economic transactions, not because the idea doesn't appeal, but because it was never technologically feasible. And I've argued that soon the technology will be in place for them to do just that.</p> <p>You may be skeptical; I would be too. The whole line of thinking has a whiff of <em>this time is different</em>. Why should you take these threats seriously when I can cite no precedent over millennia of rich and varied modes of oppression?</p> <p>I have found one example, and given that superficially similar situations have occurred throughout history, there may be a few others out there.</p> <p>When the American-allied South Vietnamese government based in Saigon fell to the communist North in 1975, the newly arrived, unabashedly authoritarian government found itself in a position to implement the sort of economic surveillance and censorship I've described. Having suffered a complete military defeat, the people of Saigon were dependent on the occupiers for food and essentials. The government issued ration cards, but revoked them from anyone who expressed opposition to the new regime.</p> <p>The North Vietnamese communists of course lacked the programmable digital money of 202X – no matter. In the situation created by South Vietnam's implosion, they were able to arbitrarily exclude people from participation in the economy using analog means. Enemies of the new government found themselves unable to obtain basic necessities through state-sanctioned channels.<sup><a href='#fn78' id='fnref78' epub:type='noteref'>78</a></sup> </p> <p>Restricting the means of exchange to friendly, compliant actors is a concept that comes naturally enough to oppressive states. Given even a relatively fleeting opportunity to do so, they'll take advantage of it. While the fall of Saigon is the only situation I've encountered that seems to fit this situation cleanly, I doubt that the North Vietnamese occupiers were uniquely creative in adopting the strategy they did: issuing a currency to a population that's used to it, but for whatever reason lacks it, opens up valuable political opportunities to mete out rewards and punishments.</p> <p>The main caveat, of course, is that such situations are likely to be temporary. As a normal cash economy reasserts itself, analog means of locking people out fail. CBDCs, though, might prove more successful in this regard.</p> <h3>CBDCs</h3> <p>Watching banks freeze accounts and payment processors censor transactions based on political considerations is disturbing, but it's piecemeal. Where such actions stem from government pressure, we can comfort ourselves with the not-implausible thought that some firms will resist the pressure. As for the activists within and outside these firms, who push them to weaponize their offerings in service of some cause, causes lose momentum. The ecosystem heals.</p> <p>For us to take comfort from this notion, though, there must <em>be </em>an ecosystem. Some number of banks and payments processors, whatever exactly that number is, must be in competition, so that customer desires factor into their decision making – not just regulatory menace and cancel-happy mobs.</p> <h4>The neutrality of money</h4> <p>For that situation to exist, money itself needs to be neutral. Deposit it to JPMorgan, Bank of America, TDBank or Wells Fargo. Send it via PayPal, ACH or an envelope stuffed with cash – it's all the same dollar. One bank might give you trouble when you try to transact with certain parties, but it's not the currency itself at the root of the trouble. Withdraw your money, deposit it to a less meddlesome bank, and carry on. Money itself, for the time being, is indifferent to who is holding it on behalf of whom, where it came from, where it's going.</p> <p>For money to be neutral<sup><a href='#fn79' id='fnref79' epub:type='noteref'>79</a></sup> requires not just fungibility – the property that ensures any given dollar has the same value as any other – but neutrality in terms of source and recipient. If a dollar can't be spent by Alice, because Alice isn't allowed to use dollars, the money is not neutral. If it can't be received by Alice, ditto. Money must remain money in any context.</p> <p>The novelist Cormac McCarthy summed it up – summed this whole essay up – better than I could:</p> <blockquote> <p>Electronic money. Sooner than you think.</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>There wont be any actual money. Just transactions. and every transaction will be a matter of record. Forever.</p> <p>You dont think people will object to this?</p> <p>They'll get used to it. The government will explain that it will help to defeat crime. Drugs. The sort of large scale international arbitrage that threatens the stability of currencies. You can make up your own list.</p> <p>But anything that you buy or sell will be a matter of record.</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>A stick of gum.</p> <p>Yes. What the government hasnt figured on yet is that this scheme will be followed by the advent of private currencies. And shutting these down will mean the rescinding of certain parts of the Constitution.<sup><a href='#fn80' id='fnref80' epub:type='noteref'>80</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>CBDCs alter the basic properties of money, rendering it shifting, unpredictable, and subject to the will of a single actor: the central bank. Competition among financial service providers no longer provides any hope that your right to transact – if you can just pick the right firm to do business with – will be respected.</p> <p>When you use a digital currency issued by a single centralized actor, that actor can constrain your use of money to an arbitrary degree. The Fed becomes PayPal, JPMorgan, and all their competitors. There is ultimately just one financial services provider, and there's no such thing as withdrawing cash.</p> <p>Of course in all likelihood the financial services industry will continue to exist. Business interests with that much power and money don't tend to simply disappear. But whatever firms you decide to patronize, there will be one ultimate arbiter of how and whether you get to use your money. In principle, even big banks could be subject to summary removal from the system – though they'll be far less vulnerable than any given individual.</p> <h4>CBDCs versus cryptocurrency</h4> <p>Those unfamiliar with CBDCs and cryptocurrency – or familiar with one but not the other – are likely to be confused about the distinction. I don't blame them: not only are these topics niche and complex, they're routinely distorted and misrepresented by ostensibly expert commentators, either through ignorance or dishonesty. (I'll return to the treatment CDBCs and crypto receive in the press later.)</p> <p>For the moment, let's imagine a scenario:</p> <p>'The European Central Bank is considering a digital currency,' a curious, intelligent, broadly informed person with no particular interest in crypto or monetary policy – let's call him Bob – might read in the news. <em>Alright, interesting</em>, Bob thinks, and goes about his day.</p> <p>A week passes. 'Crypto is digital currency,' his brother-in-law who only talks about crypto tells him.</p> <p>'Interesting,' Bob says. 'I read an article the other day about Europe adopting a digital currency. Does that mean they're going to adopt crypto?'</p> <p>'No,' the brother-in-law says, his knuckles visibly whitening around his beer bottle. 'Those are completely different things<em>.</em>' If the central bankers were within earshot, they'd say the same<em>.</em></p> <p>Not only are they different, the central bankers would add, but crypto is downright bad. Here's the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) 2021 Annual Economic Report, which I'll refer to again later:</p> <blockquote> <p>'By now, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are speculative assets rather than money, and in many cases are used to facilitate money laundering, ransomware attacks and other financial crimes. Bitcoin in particular has few redeeming public interest attributes when also considering its wasteful energy footprint.'<sup><a href='#fn81' id='fnref81' epub:type='noteref'>81</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>In 2023, the BIS followed up with a report on the 'inherent structural flaws' of crypto and recommended a program of '<em>containment</em>, <em>regulation</em> and <em>bans</em>' (emphasis in the original). Central bankers do not like crypto.</p> <p>(The BIS did acknowledge that crypto had introduced a couple of intriguing innovations, but suggested these could best be harnessed via CBDCs.<sup><a href='#fn82' id='fnref82' epub:type='noteref'>82</a></sup>)<br /> <br /> The weird brother-in-law will agree that crypto and CBDCs are completely different things, but he'll argue that CBDCs are the evil twin. 'Crypto is freedom, liberation, self-sovereignty,' he'll say. 'CBDCs are totalitarianism, panopticon, slavery. Big Brother, tyranny, social credit scores!' Give him enough time, and he'll repeat all the arguments in this essay. (It's me, I'm the brother-in-law.) </p> <p><em>Interesting</em>, Bob thinks. <em>There are two kinds of digital currency. They're different. One or the other is bad. Maybe both are. But what </em>is<em> the difference?</em> Then he'll look down at his phone. A notification from Venmo: a friend has sent him $30 for 'drinks [beer emoji]'. Isn't that<em> </em>digital money too? Bob doesn't ask. He doesn't anticipate his brother-in-law's answer doing much to clear things up.</p> <p>I'll discuss cryptocurrencies and their contrasts to CBDCs in more depth later on, but briefly: there are three forms of digital money out in the world (or soon to enter it). The first includes Venmo, PayPal, Zelle and your bank's mobile app. This is simply the legacy banking system, with new interfaces bolted on top of it. Most of the money in the world, it's no secret, is already digital, in that states are not minting coins and printing bills to account for every unit of currency in existence. Banks use computers now, as we all do.</p> <p>Their computers run code written in the 1970s in the programming-language equivalent of Assyrian cuneiform, and somewhere in the system's deepest recesses, I have no doubt, there are still paper forms being pushed around. But no need to stare into that abyss: the first form of digital money is the one you're already familiar with. It's what we refer to, day to day, as 'money.'</p> <p>The second form is cryptocurrency. The first cryptocurrency to be invented was bitcoin, in 2009, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin has since spawned many iterations, imitators, competitors (your choice of word indicates much about your loyalty to one or another crypto tribe, but isn't of much interest to us here). Prominent among these is ethereum.</p> <p>Where bitcoin is a bit like a dollar – you can hold it, you can send it to someone, someone can send it to you, and that's it<sup><a href='#fn83' id='fnref83' epub:type='noteref'>83</a></sup> – ethereum is more of a computing platform. In addition to a basic token (called ether) that can be held and sent around and not much else,<sup><a href='#fn84' id='fnref84' epub:type='noteref'>84</a></sup> ethereum enables the creation of arbitrarily complex applications, which can make use of ether or other, newly created tokens. The most popular applications so far have centered on finance – borrowing, lending, trading – and digital art collection (also financing digital art collection). These applications function using 'smart contracts,' bits of code deployed to the network the way a company might deploy code to its server.<sup><a href='#fn85' id='fnref85' epub:type='noteref'>85</a></sup> </p> <p>No need to proceed too far down that rabbit hole now. What's important to know about cryptocurrencies, in this context, is that they're decentralized. Another way of saying this: they operate without intermediaries. A few other ways: they are self-sovereign, self-custodied, non-confiscatable, censorship-resistant, bearer assets. Until 2009, no such technology existed in the world; it was a pipe dream shared by maybe a few dozen cryptography nerds, so if the concept doesn't immediately click, don't worry. It is in fact a new thing.</p> <p>Practically, what all these words mean is that if you hold crypto, no one can take it from you. No bank, tax authority, court, law enforcement body or anything of the sort can simply seize it. (That is, it's 'non-confiscatable.') No one can keep you from using it, either. You can send it anywhere you want, or do whatever transaction with it you like, within the capabilities of whatever application you're using. No one can freeze your funds (which is what 'censorship-resistant' means).</p> <p>No one needs anyone's blessing to do anything, and no one can be expelled (which is what 'permissionless' means). There is no one in the network with any coercive authority at all (which is what 'decentralized,' or if you prefer, 'self-sovereign,' means).</p> <p>Most people, when they first hear a version of this description, don't really believe it. It doesn't sound like a technology that could actually exist. I'll provide what I believe to be ample evidence that crypto fulfills this promise later on, but let me briefly address one objection: can't someone hack you, kidnap you, or imprison you, and take your funds that way?</p> <p>Yes. The 'non-confiscatable, censorship-resistant' claim is true if you accept crypto's rather narrow definition of possession. <em>Your funds</em> are funds to which you hold the cryptographic private key (which is what 'self-custody' means). If the FBI has hacked your computer and stolen your key, they're not <em>your funds</em> anymore, according to the protocol; they're the FBI's (this is what a 'bearer asset' means). Same if you've been intimidated by threats of physical harm or jail time into handing it over. But if, in the face of these threats, you manage to keep control of your private key, no power under heaven can move your funds without your approval.</p> <p>The third form of digital money, which remains more theory than practice, is a central bank digital currency. Below I'll discuss what these things are – and are likely to become – at length. For the moment, let me just contrast them to cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Where cryptocurrency is decentralized, CBDCs are entirely centralized – more so than the financial system as it currently exists. You may not use a CBDC without the central bank's permission. This will no doubt be widely, almost universally granted, but if the relevant government has placed you on a sanctions list, say, there is a central authority controlling the CBDC that will deny you access to it. This central authority can also determine under what circumstances the currency can be spent, how much of it can be held, what taxes or subsidies apply to it – in short, all the rules.</p> <p>More importantly, the central authority (this could be the central bank itself, some other part of the government to which it's subordinate, or even, in principle, a private company) can change the rules. The rules of cryptocurrency protocols do occasionally change, but only when the whole decentralized, permissionless network of validators decides to adopt the new version of the software. No one can force you to adopt the change. If it's backwards-compatible, you can continue to participate in the network without it. Otherwise, you and whoever else shares your view can 'fork' off into a new network to pursue your own trajectory. The rules of a CBDC can change by fiat from on high, instantaneously and in principle without notice.</p> <p>A central authority controls every aspect of a CBDC. No central authority exists in a cryptocurrency network.</p> <h4>CBDCs today</h4> <p>Enough about what a CBDC isn't. What <em>is </em>it? How does a central bank digital currency work?</p> <p>Empirically, the question has no satisfying answer. At the time of writing, the only retail (that is, consumer-facing) CBDC that's live, deployed and in operation across an entire economy is the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, rolled out in 2021. As of May 2022, this CBDC accounted for 0.1% of the Bahamian dollars in circulation, according to the IMF, and that in an economy that's a quarter the size of the smallest U.S. state's.<sup><a href='#fn86' id='fnref86' epub:type='noteref'>86</a></sup></p> <p>The design choices behind the Sand Dollar provide some of the only available insight into the sort of technology a real-world central bank might choose to build and launch, but there is plenty of time for that design to change, and in any case, the current design has so far seen practically no adoption. So if our goal is to paint a realistic picture of what a mature, widely adopted CBDC might look like in a major economy, the Bahamas' digital currency can only tell us so much.<sup><a href='#fn87' id='fnref87' epub:type='noteref'>87</a></sup></p> <p>China – a major economy if there ever was one – is piloting a CBDC, but describing how it works today wouldn't get us very close to the picture we're aiming for either. As with the Sand Dollar, the digital yuan's role remains basically inconsequential. Only around 10% of the population has ever transacted using e-CNY, and its share of the total value transacted in yuan is tiny.<sup><a href='#fn88' id='fnref88' epub:type='noteref'>88</a></sup> China's CBDC is in its earliest stages, and it's likely to change significantly as its role in Chinese society grows.</p> <p>Nor, for the purpose of this essay, am I especially concerned with China's CBDC. If the Bahamas is too small for its CBDC to be a useful case study, China is too authoritarian. The digital yuan will probably enhance the ruling party's surveillance and social control capabilities, but these are already unmatched almost anywhere. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) stranglehold on its citizens' free expression and civil liberties is exactly what I fear a CBDC could confer on ostensibly democratic regimes. So the digital yuan's effect on freedom, as best I can predict, will represent a difference in degree, not in kind.</p> <p>For that reason I'm more focused on the sort of digital currency the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Reserve Bank of India or Bank of England might develop. And what might those look like? It's still hard to say. </p> <p>They might bear substantial resemblance to China's version, or the Bahamas', or neither. Each is likely to debut in its own initial form, then undergo changes along its own trajectory. Defining CBDCs based on guesses about what they'll look like is difficult not just because they barely exist in the wild today, but because the shapes they take are likely to be many and in continual flux.</p> <h4>CBDCs tomorrow</h4> <p>But enough hedging. It's possible to broadly characterize what CBDCs will probably look like, at least in the early years following general adoption.</p> <p>CBDCs will exist primarily if not solely as deposits in accounts provided directly by central banks. They will be denominated in existing fiat currencies, such as the dollar, euro and yen.</p> <p>They will be digital. As noted above, most money today is already digital. A given dollar is more likely to be an artifact of a bank's database than a piece of paper. Notionally, however, the dollar transcends the bank's software systems. It can be withdrawn as a tangible dollar bill, at which point a physical, bearer instrument embodies that dollar. It can then be deposited at a different bank, where it resumes a digital form as a number on your screen (and a corresponding number on your bank's screen). But now it's in a different database, controlled by a different software system.</p> <p>A CBDC, by contrast, will be exclusively digital. A single – no doubt large, complex, sprawling, constantly updated, imperfectly maintained, but still in a basic sense unified – piece of software will define it. A single source of truth will track all balances: namely, the central bank's database.</p> <p>A dollar will no longer be a slippery, shape-shifting thing, now living in PayPal's systems, now in Bank of America's, now as 5% of a $20 bill. In each case, the financial service provider's software system – or the social mores around the use of paper bills – govern the use of that dollar. The law, while influential in all of these scenarios, has no immediate bearing on how this dollar can or cannot be used at any given time. Banks can do illegal things with their digital dollars, just as individuals can do illegal things with their physical ones. The law may step in later to roll things back and mete out punishment, or it may not.</p> <p>The digital dollar will be always and only a creature of the Fed's database, governed by the Fed's software. And the law – or the Fed's interpretation and implementation of it – will have an immediate effect on the way in which currency can be used. For the first time, the state will be able to preempt transactions it deems unacceptable. Today, it can only address such activity retroactively.</p> <p>What about physical cash? In all likelihood it will persist for a while, perhaps a surprisingly long while, at least in countries where people still use it regularly. But ultimately it's incompatible with the goals and design of a CBDC, and will be eliminated. (To be clear, 'eliminated' in a legal sense. Some form of physical currency might well lubricate black markets indefinitely. I don't feel confident predicting one way or the other.)</p> <p>Does all this mean that banks and other financial service providers won't exist? They probably will, albeit in altered forms, but the important thing is that everyone's balance – yours, the bank's, yours deposited at the bank – will ultimately be stored in the central bank's database, and access to that balance will be governed by the central bank's code.<sup><a href='#fn89' id='fnref89' epub:type='noteref'>89</a></sup> As with the elimination of cash, though, the consolidation of all currency into the CBDC orbit will take time and could conceivably fail.</p> <p>What will CBDC software enable the central bank to do with its digital money? In principle, anything. By virtue of being digital, the currency will be programmable. Such programmability can be limited, but I suspect it won't be, so the possibilities are endless. The central bank could disable any or all functionality for a given account, or manipulate that account's balance in any way it pleased.</p> <p>It could do any one of these things in response to arbitrary stimuli: actions taken by the user, the bank, the police, the stock market, the weather, a sybil in a cave – anything that can be translated into a digital message and relayed to the system, which is to say, anything. The only constraints would be law, custom, self-interest and morality, none of which provides strong guarantees when powerful incentives are at work.</p> <p>Earlier on I described the sorts of interventions and manipulations a CBDC might enable, from relatively benign to frankly horrifying. The most innocuous use case is interest payments. Central banks set interest rates. Currently they do so by setting the rate at which banks borrow from each other overnight, which – imprecisely – determines mortgage rates, the interest banks pay on customer deposits, and all other lending rates across an economy. With a CBDC, the bank could pay interest directly into depositors' accounts. It would be able to determine the rates exactly and change them in real time.</p> <p>Another advantage of a CBDC would be the ability to directly enforce measures imposed by the justice system. This possibility is not, as a rule, addressed head-on, but it's heavily implied by most discussions of the subject. A court orders the assets of a terrorist (money launderer, drug dealer, dissident) to be frozen; now, the central bank can do it directly. A court imposes a fine; now, the money can be transferred from offender to injured party directly – no need for wage garnishing, contempt hearings, sending deputies to seize moveable property, or any such hassle.</p> <p>For CBDC proponents, that's generally where the proverbial <em>part you say out loud</em> ends. Few cite the more exotic ends to which CBDCs could be applied, because they tend to make people nervous. Even the tame applications should give us pause, however.</p> <p>Take interest rates: the earliest proponents of CBDCs cited their appeal – long irrelevant, at the time of writing – as an instrument for enforcing negative interest rates.<sup><a href='#fn90' id='fnref90' epub:type='noteref'>90</a></sup> In the deflationary post-2008 environment, several central banks lowered their benchmark interest rates below 0%, what they'd once called the 'zero lower bound.' This proved problematic, as it destroyed the profitability and threatened the stability of banks that 'earned' the negative central bank rate but paid out positive rates to depositors. They had no choice: if they charged depositors for the privilege of lending their money to the bank, these customers would simply withdraw cash, setting off bank runs.</p> <p>But with a CBDC, passing negative rates through to ordinary savers presents no issue: deposits – or rather, balances, since they can't be withdrawn – are held directly at the central bank. But consider what a negative-yielding CBDC actually looks like: your savings being slowly, or not so slowly, eaten away, with nowhere else to put them. The monetary policymakers who subject you to what's in effect taxation didn't have to win elections and so can't be voted out of office. In other words, you don't have representation.</p> <p>Then there are account freezes and straightforward confiscation, which present even stickier problems. If they only resulted from orders made in open court, in accordance with real laws – the kind passed by elected legislators – that would be one thing. But I struggle to believe that CBDCs will be implemented that way. Recent decades have seen countless innovations in statecraft whereby unelected agents of the executive grant themselves new powers with scant reference to law and rare rebuke by the courts:<sup><a href='#fn91' id='fnref91' epub:type='noteref'>91</a></sup> dragnet surveillance, indefinite detention without trial, undeclared war in who-knows-how-many countries,<sup><a href='#fn92' id='fnref92' epub:type='noteref'>92</a></sup> lockdowns, social media censorship, and the whole KYC/AML apparatus. None of these innovations conform to the textbook picture of constitutional democracy and the separation of powers.</p> <p>Expecting a CBDC to break this trend, to be an exception, would be naïve.</p> <p>This is especially unlikely to happen because central banks already exist at the edge of normal government structures. 'Independent' central banking, as this approach is known, has its advantages: politicians have a tendency to demand unsustainable monetary policy giveaways as elections near. For that reason the Federal Reserve, for example, is not simply one more semi-sovereign organ of the imperial presidential bureaucracy: it lies at an even further remove from voters and their representatives.<sup><a href='#fn93' id='fnref93' epub:type='noteref'>93</a></sup> </p> <p>The bank describes itself as 'independent within government': Congress oversees it, but provides no funding; the president appoints its most senior leadership; private banks own its shares (nationally chartered ones are required to) and, through board seats at the systems' constituent regional banks, participate (alongside the presidential appointees) in the election of its other leaders.<sup><a href='#fn94' id='fnref94' epub:type='noteref'>94</a></sup> </p> <p>Other central banks are similarly distant from the normal functioning of their respective governments, though the specifics differ markedly. Insulation from the electorate and their representatives is consciously built into the logic of modern central banks.</p> <p>We should therefore expect CBDCs to resemble PayPal's Terms of Service more than the Bill of Rights. If central bankers' accustomed approach is any guide, the digital money they issue will operate in opaque, unaccountable and arbitrary ways.</p> <p>What might it be like using such an opaque, unaccountable and arbitrary system as your daily means of exchange? Perhaps minor inconveniences and indignities will be the worst of it: the consumer-facing central bank as a sort of monetary DMV.</p> <p>But if we assume that the demons of 20th century totalitarianism are still with us (they are), we should consider what a more malevolent bureaucracy might do with Turing-complete control over the currency and access to all the following personal data:<br /> </p> <ul> <li>real-time physical location</li> <li>internet browsing history</li> <li>social media posts, likes, etc.</li> <li>court records</li> <li>(to state the obvious) financial history</li> <li>video surveillance</li> <li>medical records</li> <li>genomes</li> </ul> <p>The wicked combinations to which such high-resolution data might be put can't help but excite the authoritarian imagination: what is a person who lives in your neighborhood – who looks like you – doing shopping in <em>this</em> neighborhood? Perhaps a 5% penalty should be applied to your purchases in this area to discourage your roaming. This isn't the first time? Perhaps your wallet should be disabled altogether for a while. What was that you tweeted? Perhaps a fine will discourage your rumormongering. You get the picture.</p> <p>As several commentators on the subject of CBDCs have pointed out, they enable a version of China's notorious social credit score, whereby individuals' rights – or privileges, as they've proven to be in practice – fall away when they're caught engaging in behavior the state deems unacceptable: at a certain point, offenders lose even their freedom of movement, since they're unable to use public transport or buy train or plane tickets.<sup><a href='#fn95' id='fnref95' epub:type='noteref'>95</a></sup></p> <p>As is likely to be the case with CBDCs, many of the actions that negatively impact your social credit score are, most reasonable people would agree, bad: committing fraud, racking up unpaid debts, violating traffic laws, harassing fellow passengers on the metro. But the system is arbitrary, so there's no reason to expect that only bad behavior will be punished.</p> <p>And of course, downright admirable behavior – protesting government misconduct – is liable to earn the most severe sanction, so there's no need to focus on the ways in which China's system <em>could </em>go wrong. The sort of totalitarian oppression that, in a constitutional democracy, would represent a violation of basic principles is baked into the CCP's fundamental approach to governing. (The democracies might violate their basic principles routinely, but at least such principles exist.)</p> <p>I've neglected to mention an important use to which CBDCs could be put, one that at least some CBDC advocates see as beneficial: facilitating the distribution of a universal basic income (UBI). Adequately addressing this topic would require its own essay, so I'll assume for the sake of argument that UBI is otherwise harmless. (It isn't.) But it's important to recognize that coupling a CBDC and UBI amounts to offering a financial inducement to accept the constraints and controls imposed by CBDCs. Whatever the merits of UBI, we should refuse the bribe.</p> <h4>In the central bankers' own words</h4> <p>I'll readily admit that the above is heavy on speculation.</p> <p>In an attempt to present a coherent picture of the outcome I consider most likely, I've made little effort to distinguish between what central bankers, in the harsh light of published working papers and public remarks, say about CBDCs, and what I've concluded based on historical precedent, reading between the lines, and acquaintance with the way people tend to respond to incentives.</p> <p>So let me briefly present CBDCs in the central bankers' own words: the way they describe the technology in public.</p> <p>Most major central banks have produced a healthy volume of literature on CBDCs, almost all of it basically the same. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the 'central banks' central bank,' has published some of the most in-depth discussions of CBDC design, and it's the rare item of CBDC literature by any author that doesn't cite BIS work.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the BIS 2021 Annual Economic Report<sup><a href='#fn96' id='fnref96' epub:type='noteref'>96</a></sup> contains the bank's most detailed treatment of the subject, so I'll summarize the relevant chapter below, adding citations from other central bank publications where appropriate.</p> <p>CBDCs, the BIS writes, 'are a form of digital money, denominated in the national unit of account, which is a direct liability of the central bank.' Simple enough. It distinguishes two forms: wholesale CBDCs, which are limited to use by financial institutions; and retail CBDCs, which are what I've been discussing here, a digital replacement for cash.</p> <p>The BIS divides this latter category, retail CBDCs, into two types: 'cashlike' digital currency using 'token-based access,' and an approach using 'account-based access.'</p> <p>The first approach would enable anonymous transactions, hence the comparison to cash. The technological architecture would resemble crypto, in that holding a token<sup><a href='#fn97' id='fnref97' epub:type='noteref'>97</a></sup> representing a dollar or euro would give one the ability to spend that token – period. It doesn't matter how they came by it, or by extension, what they intend to do with it. The BIS dismisses this option, saying it could 'facilitate illegal activity, and is therefore unlikely to serve the public interest.'</p> <p>The bank is more amenable to a system in which everyone's digital currency tokens are associated with an account, and each account is associated with a real-world identity. This identity could draw on 'information from national registries and from other public and private sources, such as education certificates, tax and benefits records, property registries etc.'</p> <p>In a 2020 publication, the ECB wrote that the digital euro could be designed such that 'all payment devices would require users to validate their identities' using – for example – 'information on physical attributes of the intended user (known as biometrics, e.g. fingerprint and iris recognition).'<sup><a href='#fn98' id='fnref98' epub:type='noteref'>98</a></sup></p> <p>The BIS points out that such a system serves 'to establish individual identities online.'<sup><a href='#fn99' id='fnref99' epub:type='noteref'>99</a></sup> In 2021 the ECB, summarizing the results of its experiments in digital euro design, pointed out that a CBDC 'may require the widespread adoption of an e-ID solution.'<sup><a href='#fn100' id='fnref100' epub:type='noteref'>100</a></sup> As the BIS notes, such a system could 'circumvent the need for paper-based documentation.' More important than reducing paperwork, however, is 'the monitoring of illicit activity' as well as 'preventing fraud and bolstering efforts to counter money laundering.'</p> <p>This KYC'd system need not, the BIS insists, necessarily compromise users' privacy: 'personal transaction data could be shielded from commercial parties and even from public authorities.' It urges that 'safeguards' be put in place to protect privacy, and describes some candidates, such as a voucher system for small transactions maintained by a 'separate data registrar.'</p> <p>The ECB experiments mentioned above showed that 'a very high degree of privacy' is attainable but, it seems, undesirable: it 'would require further analysis to verify that the high level of privacy did not violate AML/CFT regulatory requirements.' The bank also notes that 'the experiments were based on the underlying assumption of each citizen only having one digital euro account/wallet.'</p> <p>In its 2022 annual report, the BIS shifts rhetorical tack, saying that CBDCs would in fact be private – but treating KYC and surveillance by the central bank and law enforcement as consistent with 'privacy.' The bank argues that 'central banks have no commercial interest in personal data, and can thus credibly design systems in the public interest.' It then gestures at zero-knowledge proofs (a bit of cryptography that could, for example, attest to a user's KYC status without revealing personal details) and concludes: 'Achieving both goals – of respecting privacy while using real names – can be accomplished by using public key cryptography.'<sup><a href='#fn101' id='fnref101' epub:type='noteref'>101</a></sup></p> <p>Another report, published by the BIS and the World Bank in 2022, points out that 'validation of the KYC status of a payer and payee can be made a pre-condition and enforced by the CBDC system for any transfer over a threshold amount.' Digital currencies would also allow other, unspecified 'regulatory requirements to be programmed into the CBDC design.'<sup><a href='#fn102' id='fnref102' epub:type='noteref'>102</a></sup></p> <p>This is a reference to the potential programmability of CBDCs, something that's often gestured at in the official literature, but usually not elaborated on. The ECB is typical in its treatment of the topic:<br /> </p> <blockquote> <p>'The potential addition of programmability features to a digital euro was also investigated because the provision of additional logical conditions linked to the payment instructions (that could be defined by third parties) could support innovative business processes and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money and control the conditions of its allocation and use.'<sup><a href='#fn103' id='fnref103' epub:type='noteref'>103</a></sup><br /> </p> </blockquote> <p>In a 2020 discussion paper on CBDC design, the Bank of England (BOE) elaborates on the topic, noting that smart contracts, such as those used on ethereum, could enable conditional payments: 'If X happens, then pay Y to Z.' Delivery of goods could trigger an automated transfer to the vendor, for example. Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) devices would also be possible: 'when £X is transferred to account Y, switch on device Z.'<sup><a href='#fn104' id='fnref104' epub:type='noteref'>104</a></sup></p> <p>The BOE sounds nervous about introducing an application layer to its CBDC, however. First, security: every hack that has ever occurred on ethereum – excepting theft of individual private keys – has been due to a vulnerability in smart contract code. Second, performance: processing instructions of arbitrary complexity takes time and computing power, and the added benefits of programmability might not outweigh the extra lag experienced by the whole system. The BOE proposes limiting the range of available smart contract instructions – making the platform less than Turing-complete – or hiving smart contracts off into a separate module as potential solutions.</p> <p>In the 2021 BIS report, there follows some discussion of potential technical implementations of a retail CBDC: a popular option is what bankers call 'distributed ledger technology' or DLT, a protocol similar to bitcoin's ledger (also called a <em>blockchain</em>), but with the difference that the parties maintaining the ledger would be 'permissioned': able to validate the network only if invited to do so by the central bank.<sup><a href='#fn105' id='fnref105' epub:type='noteref'>105</a></sup></p> <p>The BIS also addresses 'division of labour between the central bank and the private sector.' In short, the bank argues that it would be overambitious and counter-productive for the central bank to take over the 'user-facing' roles that private companies such as commercial banks currently perform. The authors argue for a 'two-tier system, where the central bank and the private sector each play their respective role.' They acknowledge, however, that if consumers hold accounts directly with the central bank, 'some operational involvement of the central bank is inevitable.'</p> <p>The publication proposes caps on the value depositors can hold directly with the central bank as one way of establishing a division of labor between itself and the private sector. (Speaking of caps, the ECB assures that it 'is possible to introduce limits on balances and transaction amounts regardless of the underlying technology.'<sup><a href='#fn106' id='fnref106' epub:type='noteref'>106</a></sup>)</p> <p>The BIS also floats a system in which the CBDC doesn't track individual transactions, leaving that to commercial banks. It leaves the possibility open, however, for the central bank to maintain a 'full record of CBDC transactions.'</p> <p>Another BIS publication, 'Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features,' prepared in partnership with the Bank of Canada, ECB, BOE, Bank of Japan, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank), Federal Reserve, and Swiss National Bank, is interesting in that its tone is less restrained than that of most of the other literature these same institutions put out on the subject.<sup><a href='#fn107' id='fnref107' epub:type='noteref'>107</a></sup></p> <p>Rather than entertaining the preservation of cashlike anonymity, or pretending to, the authors state flatly: 'Full anonymity is not plausible.' CBDCs must conform to KYC, AML and other regulations, they say, going on to urge 'strong coordination with relevant domestic government agencies (e.g. tax authorities).' (Central bank publications generally don't explicitly reference such close liaisons between the issuers of currency and law enforcement, though they constantly imply it.)</p> <p>'For a CBDC and its system,' they continue, 'payments data will exist, and a key national policy question will be deciding who can access which parts of it and under what circumstances.'</p> <p>The authors go further, addressing the ability of central banks to ''lock' stolen funds or query suspicious transactions.' (Central bankers often gesture towards <em>combating illicit activity</em>, but rarely state the actual mechanisms of control that must be involved.)</p> <p>The report's authors discuss direct stimulus payments to a country's residents, citing precedents set during covid. They mention potential 'helicopter drops' of money during periods of low demand, as well as the ability of CBDCs to bear interest when the economy is healthier. They propose a 'programmable monetary policy,' giving as an example 'transfers with an 'expiry date' or conditional on being spent on certain goods.'</p> <p>Again, this publication is an outlier due to its relatively frank discussion of the concentrated power central banks will wield once CBDCs are introduced: the ability to surveil the whole universe of transactions and freeze assets where they suspect wrongdoing; the ability to control what goods funds may be spent on and to set time limits on funds' availability.</p> <p>Most written materials prepared by central banks for public consumption are more staid: they explore questions such as whether CBDCs should enable cash-like anonymity, weigh the options, and arrive at the predictable result, the one granting them more visibility and control. </p> <p>But they maintain a tone of detached concern for the public welfare. They propose a solution that would tie every economic transaction of any value to a detailed, state-issued identity – tucking this fearsome measure behind the innocuous term 'account-based' CBDC – and then they make sure to stress the importance of 'safeguards.'</p> <p>I should also note – since I've argued that central banks will move to eliminate cash as soon as they feel it's feasible, that a number of publications say the opposite. In 2020, for example, the ECB wrote, 'A digital euro would be introduced alongside cash, it would not replace it.'<sup><a href='#fn108' id='fnref108' epub:type='noteref'>108</a></sup></p> <p>So much for what the bankers say in public. Behind closed doors, they're less shy. As I was writing this section, I found myself growing frustrated with the material available to me. Absent a clear incentive to protect people's privacy and autonomy – which I don't see any evidence of – there is no reason, in my opinion, to expect a large, unaccountable bureaucratic organ like a central bank to care about such protections.</p> <p>This strikes me as common sense: an individual can act nobly, quixotically, irrationally – any way at all – but large organizations act, on net, in accord with their incentives. When it comes to designing digital currencies, central bankers have, on the one hand, a powerful incentive to take up the proverbial crown lying in the gutter and create a tool of immense power – one that few seem inclined to stop them from wielding. On the other hand, they have a flimsy incentive to give up any this power, to voluntarily cede privacy and autonomy to the currency's users, because it would be a nice thing to do.</p> <p>Still, there was little I could point to that central bankers had actually said which would indicate their willingness to create the sort of panopticon that all logic and historical precedent says they will. When describing CBDCs in their own words, central bankers only hinted at the tool's more sinister capabilities and expressed solemn concern at the prospect of violating civil liberties. Strong if vaguely defined defenses would be contrived to prevent such violations, they promised.</p> <p>And then a video surfaced that, at first, I dismissed as a fake. The footage was of a Zoom call, and on screen was Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB.<sup><a href='#fn109' id='fnref109' epub:type='noteref'>109</a></sup> Unseen was a man engaged in what struck me as a malicious parody of I-wasn't-sure-what Eastern European accent. My first impression was that it was a joke: Lagarde's interlocutor in some real Zoom call had been replaced by a character in the mold of Borat.</p> <p>But the man with the accent wasn't joking, exactly, and Lagarde was clearly answering the questions he was asking. Nor was it an AI generation; or if it was, it was the best AI generation I'd seen by miles.<sup><a href='#fn110' id='fnref110' epub:type='noteref'>110</a></sup> The real Christine Lagarde was in fact giving sincere answers to someone she thought was Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but turned out to be a prankster who has talked his way into interviews with multiple public figures.<sup><a href='#fn111' id='fnref111' epub:type='noteref'>111</a></sup></p> <p>And what she was telling him, among other things, was her candid take on the ECB's plans for a digital euro.</p> <p>Mentioning that whether to move forward with a CBDC would be decided in October 2023 (the end of an 'investigation phase' launched in 2021),<sup><a href='#fn112' id='fnref112' epub:type='noteref'>112</a></sup> she said 'I'm personally convinced that we have to move ahead' due to Europe's dependence on 'the supply of gas by a very unfriendly country,' by which she meant Russia.</p> <p>'I don't want Europe to be dependent on an unfriendly country's currency,' Lagarde said. 'For instance, I don't know, you know, the Chinese currency, the Russian currency, the whatever – or dependent on a friendly currency, but which is activated by a private corporate entity like, you know, Facebook or like Google or anybody like that.'<sup><a href='#fn113' id='fnref113' epub:type='noteref'>113</a></sup></p> <p>Fake Zelenskyy asked why some Europeans oppose the introduction of a CBDC. She didn't answer the question, but said that support is strong in Germany and the Netherlands. So Fake Zelenskyy pressed the point: 'the problem is they don't want to be controlled.'</p> <p>Lagarde's response merits quoting at length:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Yeah, but you know what? You know what? Now we have in Europe this threshold above one thousand euros, you cannot pay cash. If you do, you are on the gray market. You take your risk. You get caught, you are fined or you go in jail.<br /> <br /> 'But you know, the digital euro is going to have a limited amount of control. There will be control. You're right. You're completely right. We are considering whether for very small amounts, you know, anything that is around 300, 400 euros, we could have a mechanism where there is zero control.<br /> <br /> 'But that could be dangerous. The terrorist attacks on France back 10 years ago were entirely financed by those very small anonymous credit cards that you can recharge in total anonymity.' </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>In short, Lagarde admitted the obvious: surveillance and censorship of the digital euro is part of the plan. 'Control' is not an unfortunate side effect of the design tradeoffs involved in building a CBDC; it's the point.</p> <p>If the state (or a supranational institution like the ECB) can't intervene arbitrarily in any transaction, however small or otherwise innocuous, Bad People might do Bad Things. Lagarde selects as her boogeymen the perennial favorite: terrorists. She could just as easily have invoked organized crime, Russia (which she did), pedophiles, or billionaires. Every place and time has its own ensemble of criminals and subversives, but the line is always the same: to stop them, we need more power, so you give up your rights.</p> <p>Lagarde's discussion of a 'limited amount of control' is illuminating. Vows to safeguard privacy and civil liberties generally come off as disingenuous and hand-wavy, but Lagarde dismisses the topic in four words: 'that could be dangerous.' She clearly articulates the attitude that central bankers generally try to obfuscate: they would find anything short of total control unacceptable.</p> <p>Augustín Carstens, General Manager of the BIS and former head of Mexico's central bank, expressed a similar sentiment in 2020, speaking on a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He emphasized the 'huge difference' between a CBDC and cash, and celebrated the 'absolute control' CBDCs grant to their administrators, in contrast to cash:</p> <blockquote> <p> 'We tend to establish equivalence with cash, and there is a huge difference there. For example in cash, we don't know for example who's using a $100 bill today, we don't know who's using a 1000 peso bill today. A key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.'<sup><a href='#fn114' id='fnref114' epub:type='noteref'>114</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The context was a discussion of financial stability: what implications would CBDCs have for monetary policy responses to crises? But Carstens' answer focused on the ability to surveil and censor transactions. He went on to point out, 'if an advanced economy issues a CBDC and somebody in a third country wants to use it, it will require the consent of the central bank of the residence of that person. Therefore the degree of control will be far bigger.'</p> <h4>What's left unsaid</h4> <p>As I mentioned, Carstens was speaking on an IMF panel – a virtual one, given the year. While not a central bank, the IMF shares the BIS' transnational policy orbit (the BIS, of course, isn't a central bank either). The fund has demonstrated a keen interest in the development of CBDCs, not infrequently marked at least by enthusiasm for the power such currencies would grant policymakers.</p> <p>In a 2022 publication entitled 'Digital Currencies and Energy Consumption,' the IMF discusses ways in which a digital currency could alleviate climate impacts. It points out that 'programmability features of digital currencies (for example, smart contracts) could support precise policies such as incentivization of climate-friendly behaviors by users and environmental impact accounting.'<sup><a href='#fn115' id='fnref115' epub:type='noteref'>115</a></sup> </p> <p>It doesn't elaborate on this suggestion. The main body of the report ends with that sentence. But the implications are potentially vast: built into the currency itself would be mechanisms that encourage or discourage spending on certain goods and services.</p> <p>What mechanisms? Would tofu carry a slight subsidy, gasoline a slight tax? Would the currency simply be unspendable on certain products? Under what circumstances? Would individuals' carbon footprints be tracked, and if so, what would be done with that information? If you reach your CO<sub>2</sub> ceiling in October, are you allowed to keep buying food and heating your home for the rest of the year?</p> <p>The IMF declines to address the gorey details, but even to mention 'incentivization of climate-friendly behaviors' raises these questions. If an institution is given the ability to program money, it will. Digital currencies will be context-aware, capable of behaving one way under one set of circumstances, another way under another. Money will have eyes and ears. What precisely do central banks intend to do with such capabilities? They want them, so they should explain why.</p> <p>Until they do, we should read between the lines. We should also try to project a few years in the future: if these are the initial conditions present in a newly introduced CBDC, how do predictable trends and plausible events influence its course of development?</p> <p>Say a CBDC is introduced with a cap on individual holdings of $250,000. The stated purpose – perhaps the sincere motivation – is to protect the role of commercial banks in the financial system. But what if, through some unforeseen consequence of introducing CBDCs, getting a private-sector bank account becomes more difficult? For most people, in that case, the central bank currency is the only option, meaning a limit of $250,000 in liquid assets has in effect been imposed for all but a shrinking elite of connected or grandfathered-in bank account holders.</p> <p>As inflation goes to work, the real value of this cap drops: 20 years later, the maximum cash savings permitted to the vast majority of the population is a modest one-year salary. (Letting a crucial system metastasize so drastically isn't all that unusual: consider Social Security.)</p> <p>These aren't the sorts of discussions we get from central banks and the BIS. Despite publishing thousands of pages collectively on the topic in any given year, these institutions re-tread the same small handful of topics. They acknowledge risks – but in the most anodyne, sanitary way possible. We don't get even the briefest glimpse into the totalitarian maw of programmable money fed on infinite personal data; we hear threadbare notes of caution about Privacy. But these are swiftly dismissed as 'not plausible' or 'dangerous': privacy could help terrorists, so it's out of the question.</p> <p>The so-called benefits of CBDCs are likewise abstracted away. <em>Combating illicit activity</em> … <em>promoting sustainable behaviors</em> … Well that sounds nice, but how? Not a word on the details. Any number of deeply undemocratic power-grabs are implied by these proposals, but the institutions decline to elaborate.<br /> <br /> Practically no one with any sort of institutional backing is willing to describe a plausible vision of how retail CBDCs would – practically, from the consumer's perspective – promote these nebulous social goals. </p> <p>The rare exception is Eswar Prasad, former chief of the IMF's China Division and current professor of trade policy at Cornell University. Speaking at a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in June 2023, he volunteered (neither the journalist interviewing him nor any of the audience members prompted him) a description of programmable CBDCs, and warned central banks not to adopt them:</p> <blockquote> <p>'If you think about the benefits of digital money, there are huge potential gains. It's not just about digital forms of physical currency, you can have programmability: you know, units of central bank currency with expiry dates. You could have, as I argue in my book, a potentially better and some people might say a darker world where the government decides that units of central bank money can be used to purchase some things, but not other things that it deems less desirable, let's say ammunition or drugs or pornography or something of the sort, and that is very powerful in terms of the use of a CBDC and I think also extremely dangerous for central banks.<br /> <br /> 'Because ultimately if you have different units of central bank money with different characteristics, or if you use central bank money as a conduit for economic policies in a very targeted way, or more broadly for social policies, that could really affect the integrity of central bank money and the integrity and independence of central banks. So there are wonderful notions of things that can be done with digital money, but again I fear that technology could take us to a better place, but equally has the potential to take us to a pretty dark place.'<sup><a href='#fn116' id='fnref116' epub:type='noteref'>116</a></sup> </p> </blockquote> <h4>Enter the media</h4> <p>Prasad's description of CBDCs got the sort of play on social media that Lagarde's 'control' line and Carstens' 'absolute control' line did: Twitter and Instagram users recoiled at the totalitarian agenda that introduces a police state under the guise of modernizing the payments infrastructure. As they should.<br /> <br /> But the videos were edited to cut Prasad off before he says 'and I think also extremely dangerous' and explains that central banks should not go down this road. They make his comments about 'huge potential gains' seem unqualified. The World Economic Forum label behind his head makes him look like a WEF ghoul praising the monetary panopticon.<br /> <br /> Which is unfortunate, but people misrepresent each other's views on social media all the time. Why is this particular incident relevant to us here? I mention it because the Associated Press saw fit to publish a 'fact check' of these posts, declaring them 'false.'<sup><a href='#fn117' id='fnref117' epub:type='noteref'>117</a></sup> </p> <p> The AP's reasoning is sound enough: Prasad doesn't work for the WEF, he was just speaking at an event. So he isn't a 'WEF agent,' as one post claimed. And portraying him, personally, as 'calling for' the sort of CBDC he describes is unfair.<br /> <br /> But is the basic message of these posts false? Central banks and international policy bodies are contemplating exactly the sort of technology Prasad describes, and if they aren't contemplating it, they should be: they're actively testing and piloting it, so a bit of thought is in order. Proceeding blindly, without considering any consequences, would hardly excuse them. The AP goes on to 'fact check' the idea that the WEF is calling for a 'cashless society,' which it doesn't, except when it does.<sup><a href='#fn118' id='fnref118' epub:type='noteref'>118</a></sup> The AP even invokes the label of 'conspiracy theories,' without quite calling the post it's fact checking an offender.<br /> <br /> Criticizing CBDCs as tools for surveillance and social control, in perhaps the least surprising development of the last couple of years, has been deemed <em>misinformation </em>by the press. The <em>fact checkers</em> have emerged to quibble with CBDC critics over details, <em>debunk</em> any attack on those grounds and, often as not, caution that <em>spreading</em> <em>misinformation</em> on CBDCs is <em>dangerous</em>: what if our policymaking betters decide that they do want to introduce exactly the sort of technology the <em>conspiracy theorists</em> are warning us about? Then there could be opposition – debate, even – and the institutions might have trouble getting their way. Democracy must be protected from public debate and the voters. </p> <p>(It feels superfluous to spell this out, but I'd rather not leave it unsaid: not all that long ago, the press chided institutions for lying to and failing to serve the populace. The Pentagon Papers, Watergate, Snowden. Now they chide the populace for – they allege – lying about and failing to serve institutions.)<br /> <br /> Complaining about the media is no way to spend one's precious days on earth, so I'll let one more example suffice. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who at the time of writing is running for the Republican presidential nomination, is a critic of CBDCs. </p> <p> In April 2023, the New York Times published a piece accusing DeSantis of 'spreading misinformation about central bank digital currency.'<sup><a href='#fn119' id='fnref119' epub:type='noteref'>119</a></sup></p> <p>The authors mentioned two specific instances: an item of legislation DeSantis proposed in order to 'protect Floridians from the Biden administration's weaponization of the financial sector through a central bank digital currency' and DeSantis' allegation, in a speech, that Democrats want to 'impose an E.S.G. [environmental, social and governance] agenda' through CBDCs. According to the article, the latter statement has 'no factual basis.'<br /> <br /> The Times points out that 'there is no plan to issue a digital currency.' True enough: the Fed has not announced a plan to develop or deploy a CBDC. It is conducting pilots, most notably the Boston Fed's Project Hamilton, and Biden signed an executive order in 2022 calling on federal agencies to explore a U.S. CDBD.<sup><a href='#fn120' id='fnref120' epub:type='noteref'>120</a></sup> But compared to its European and Chinese counterparts, the Fed is proceeding slowly with its CBDC program. </p> <p>As for the allegation that Democrats want to impose ESG measures through a CBDC, calling the statement misinformation seems like, well, misinformation. Prominent Democrats including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ohio Senator Brown have expressed support for an American CBDC.<sup><a href='#fn121' id='fnref121' epub:type='noteref'>121</a></sup> Neither, to my knowledge, has directly stated that they'd like a CBDC to enforce ESG priorities, but just about every discussion of the topic touts CBDCs' ability to combat money laundering, tax evasion and crime (sometimes even climate change) – so drawing a link between ESG priorities and CBDCs is perfectly justified.</p> <p>Brown encouraged federal regulators to impose ESG priorities on the private sector as recently as 2022, issuing the following statement on a new climate disclosure rule: 'I applaud the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] for acting to address climate risks to protect workers, investors, and our economy.'<sup><a href='#fn122' id='fnref122' epub:type='noteref'>122</a></sup> Warren, meanwhile, has formed an 'Anti-Crypto Army' to destroy one of the only means of escaping a social policy-oriented centralized digital currency.<sup><a href='#fn123' id='fnref123' epub:type='noteref'>123</a></sup><br /> <br /> And the Biden administration, as detailed above, has mounted a concerted campaign of social media censorship in order to further its social policy goals. Why not censor people's spending as well as their speech? (Hell, Canada's doing it.)<br /> <br /> So what exactly is baseless about DeSantis' claims? He was warning people of a perfectly plausible outcome. To the extent he exaggerated, made the merely plausible sound like fact, he's earned his fact-check. But is it 'misinformation' to characterize CBDCs as potentially disastrous, and to criticize those who express sympathy for the idea? </p> <p>Here's all the Times' article would concede to those skeptical of CBDCs: 'critics have worried about the privacy concerns of a centralized digital dollar.' No elaboration.<sup><a href='#fn124' id='fnref124' epub:type='noteref'>124</a></sup></p> <p>The real problem with DeSantis' stance, the article suggests, is that 'a lack of popular support could curb the Fed's room to maneuver: If the government decided that pursuing a digital currency was a good idea, for instance, the backlash could make it more difficult to do so.'<br /> <br /> Which is to say, we owe it to the bureaucracy to let it pursue whatever policies it likes. Scrutiny is dangerous and, frankly, presumptuous.<br /> <br /> In other words, central bank digital currencies aren't happening, and it's a good thing that they are. </p> <p>(I said I'd only do one example, but I can't resist sharing the zinger at the end of Paul Krugman's Times op-ed, also in response DeSantis' statements about CDBCs: 'But hey, I guess thinking that money laundering and extortion are bad things is just another example of the wokeness that DeSantis is trying to kill.'<sup><a href='#fn125' id='fnref125' epub:type='noteref'>125</a></sup>)</p> <h4>Code speaks louder than words</h4> <p>As I thought I was putting the finishing touches on this essay, I came across a Github repository for a Brazilian CBDC pilot.<sup><a href='#fn126' id='fnref126' epub:type='noteref'>126</a></sup> It confirmed that the designers of CBDCs, at least at the Central Bank of Brazil (Bacen), are experimenting with exactly the sort of perpetually surveilled, freezable, seizable currency I've described above.<br /> <br /> Frankly all that reading between the lines of central bank white papers – even the candid interview with Lagarde – seems superfluous now. I've left the foregoing exegesis in place, because it's useful to establish that Bacen is not some isolated rogue actor, but carrying out a vision shared to some degree by basically every central bank. It's also useful to sample a range of thinking around the topic of CBDCs, because I suspect that Bacen's 'Digital Real pilot' (the name given in the repo's readme) may not represent the technical direction that other central banks – perhaps even Brazil's – ultimately pursue.<br /> <br /> Still, for what I believe is the first time, a major economy's central bank has made the code for a CBDC publicly available. And code speaks louder than words. </p> <p>Admittedly, we don't have the code exactly. The repo doesn't contain the smart contracts themselves, but technical documentation and specifications describing them. Most interesting are the application binary interfaces (ABIs), files that detail the precise arguments and outputs of each function in their respective smart contracts. These files are automatically generated based on valid code, so the ABIs' existence implies that the smart contracts have been planned in detail and perhaps – though there's no way of knowing – substantially completed.</p> <p>While the names of the functions themselves are clear enough, Bacen provides documentation describing their uses (the function names are in English in the original; the descriptions are translated from Portuguese):</p> <blockquote> <p><code>disableAccount</code>: 'Disables the wallet.'</p> <p><code>verifyAccount</code>: 'Checks if the wallet can receive the token.'</p> <p><code>increaseFrozenBalance</code>: 'Function to increment partially locked tokens of a wallet. Only those who possess.'</p> <p><code>move</code>: 'Function to move tokens from one wallet to another. Only those who possess MOVER_ROLE can execute.'</p> <p><code>pause</code>: 'Function to pause the token in necessary cases, blocking it for all operations.'</p> </blockquote> <p> In plain language, these contracts encode the ability for the central bank (or whoever it grants the permissions associated with <code>FREEZER_ROLE</code>, <code>MOVER_ROLE</code>, etc.) to disable certain people's access to the national currency; to freeze some or all of their funds; to confiscate their funds (to summarily 'move' them out of one account into another); and – I'll admit I didn't see this one coming – to turn off the entire currency, for everyone everywhere, by flipping a single switch. </p> <p>(To be clear, the contract also includes functions to reverse these operations: <code>enableAccount</code>, <code>decreaseFrozenBalance</code> and <code>unpause</code>; <code>move</code>, called with different arguments, can reverse a prior call to <code>move</code>.) </p> <p>The repo doesn't reveal what platform these contracts would be deployed on. It almost certainly wouldn't be public ethereum, which would be too slow and expensive to host a CBDC. Likely the central bank would deploy its own blockchain replicating ethereum's smart contract execution environment (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM), but eschewing features and design that aren't necessary for its use case.</p> <p>On ethereum, all transactions are completely public. Presumably the bank would change that: the public ledger is a measure to enable decentralization, which isn't necessary when a single institution controls the network. But unless they were to adopt a radically private version of the EVM – such things do exist, though 'zero-knowledge' or zkEVMs are bleeding-edge and far from tested at the time of writing – the state will have a complete, transparent ledger of every single transaction anyone performs. The Digital Real will be perfectly surveilled.</p> <p>I'd also like to elaborate a bit on one of these functions, move, since I think it illustrates the sort of power CBDCs confer on their issuers. According to the ABI and documentation, here's what the function does: a user with MOVER_ROLE permissions calls the function with three arguments: from (the user whose funds are being moved), to (the user who will receive the funds), and amount (how much money is being moved).</p> <p>Since I don't have access to the smart contract code itself, assuming it exists, I can't say exactly how the function is implemented, but logically, the contract will check that from holds funds equaling or exceeding amount.<sup><a href='#fn127' id='fnref127' epub:type='noteref'>127</a></sup> It will probably check that to is a 'verified' account, capable of receiving funds. And logically, we can expect that the MOVER_ROLE user calling the function will work at the central bank or elsewhere in the government.</p> <p>What we shouldn't expect is for the function to check that the funds are being confiscated lawfully – in response to a court order, for example. We certainly shouldn't expect that from will need to consent to the operation. The former is difficult to encode in a smart contract (though perhaps not impossible). If the latter were the case, there would be no need for the move function.</p> <p>If something like the Digital Real pilot were to go live, Brazilians would be granting their central bank the ability to instantaneously freeze and seize their funds at any time; to disable their ability to use the national currency; even to disable the national currency entirely.</p> <p>That's far more power than any institution has ever had over any nation's economic life, so the question is: how strong are the legal and institutional constraints available for keeping these newly made demigods in check?<sup><a href='#fn128' id='fnref128' epub:type='noteref'>128</a></sup></p> <h4>Whose programmability?</h4> <p>I should also address something that's crucial to understanding the gulf between what central bankers say about CBDCs, and what they leave unsaid – but imply every time they discuss the topic.</p> <p>Central bankers use the term 'programmability' in two distinct ways, often within the same sentence. Take this one about potential 'programmability features' from the ECB, already cited above: 'the provision of additional logical conditions linked to the payment instructions (that could be defined by third parties) could support innovative business processes and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money.'<sup><a href='#fn129' id='fnref129' epub:type='noteref'>129</a></sup></p> <p>The first part of the sentence refers to the application layer. This sort of programmability – a better word might be <em>composability</em> – would give third parties the ability to build applications on top of the base layer by deploying smart contracts, as developers do on ethereum.</p> <p>Of course permission to deploy such applications would not be completely open, as it is on ethereum (I haven't seen this stated directly, but it seems obvious). Smart contracts could only be written by developers the central bank trusts. A rough parallel, for those less familiar with crypto, would be third-party developers building apps for the iPhone: a vetted, but possibly quite large, community of outsiders writing code that sits on top of the core operating system.</p> <p>Using such smart contracts, a city could integrate public transportation turnstiles with its country's CBDC wallet. The cashier at the café could use a device integrated with the CBDC wallet via smart contracts. Same with the phone you tap against these devices. A big e-commerce company could wire its system up with the CBDC via smart contracts so that when an employee scans a returned item, a refund is automatically sent to the customer's wallet.</p> <p>I don't see anything wrong with this. There are risks – hacks, hits to system performance from needing to support too much arbitrary logic – but the central banks understand them. They can probably overcome them. And anyway, giving people a platform to build on is good: it encourages growth and promotes efficiency.</p> <p>But the central banks perform a clever bait-and-switch in these discussions. They define <em>programmability (noun) </em>as the above: building on the application layer. They make it sound smart and innovative, because it probably is. But then they make references to the capabilities of a CBDC – 'and help central banks to define the properties of central bank money' – which imply a second sort of programmability they don't distinguish explicitly. </p> <p>This second sort is built into the base layer, and can only be augmented or altered by the central bank's own developers: not apps, to return to the earlier analogy, but the iPhone operating system itself, which is only programmable if you work at Apple. This is the sort of programmability I refer to elsewhere in this essay: the ability of the central bank to work whatever logic they like into the joints and marrow of the currency.</p> <p>When central bankers propose building KYC/AML checks into the transaction logic of a CBDC, this is base-layer programmability. Interest rates (positive or negative), caps on holdings, taxes, subsidies, limits on spending, removal from the system – all of this would be possible not because outside developers could deploy applications on top of a CBDC, but because central banks could build such logic into its core.</p> <p>Smart contract 'programmability' is marketing and, in isolation, would probably improve the world. Base-layer programmability lends the state dangerous, unprecedented power.</p> <p>Naturally, there's an annoying caveat to this clean division. It's entirely possible to build a CBDC using the application layer. The Brazilian proof of concept I mentioned above is an example. First, deploy an ethereum-like chain, a base layer that isn't decentralized like ethereum, but isn't extensively modified to perform KYC checks either. Next, encode a CBDC (allowing for summary freezes and confiscations, if you want, go wild) into a smart contract.</p> <p>In this case, the <em>base-layer</em> programmability I described above doesn't actually occur on the base layer. That said, as far as users and outside developers are concerned, it might as well. To use the chain, you have to interact with that smart contract. The CBDC contract isn't one of several options available to you, but in all likelihood, the only user-facing application on the chain. Only the government can manipulate and configure it. The <em>real</em> application layer, if any, sits on top of that contract.</p> <p>I can see why people experimenting with CBDCs build this way. It's easy to build on the application layer; that's why it exists. Let's say we want to check a user's social credit score every time they try to spend money. If their score is less than, say, 65, the transfer fails:</p> <pre> function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) { address from = msg.sender; if ( minimumSocialCreditScore > socialCreditScores[from] ) { revert SenderSocialCreditScoreTooLow( socialCreditScores[from], minimumSocialCreditScore ); } // ... return ERC20.transfer(to, amount); } </pre> <p>For the full contract, see the appendix. All in, building it took a couple of hours. Having worked on smart contracts for ERC20 tokens before, I knew pretty much exactly what I'd be writing before I started. There are thousands of developers who could say the same.</p> <p>Building similar functionality into the base layer of a digital currency would take I'm-not-sure-how-long, because I wouldn't know where to start. While I'm confident I and any number of other people could figure it out, the pool of developers who can jump straight into that kind of task – and avoid I'm-not-sure-what pitfalls – is much smaller.</p> <p>Would a smart contract CBDC provide a satisfactory technical solution for daily use by tens or hundreds of millions of people? I can't say. What I can say is that when central banks mention smart contracts, they want you to think of whizzy IoT integrations, not automated freezes and confiscations.</p> <h4>Who elected you?</h4> <p>It may be that central bankers' public statements are honest and transparent: they wish to combat money laundering, tax evasion and other crimes (not that these other crimes are ever specified). In other words, the boogeymen, and only the boogeymen, will be affected by CBDCs' less-pleasant capabilities.</p> <p>And in all honesty, who would complain if ISIS saw its funding disrupted, or cartel bosses had trouble buying sports cars, or the offshore bankers who cater to such clients felt a bit of a pinch? No collateral damage, just bad people earning their just desserts? Sure, why not.</p> <p>Even if that were somehow the case, though, in what world is a central bank an appropriate institution to play this role? Central banks aren't law enforcement agencies. If they're to become law enforcement agencies, what exactly is their jurisdiction? Surely CBDCs can't be tasked with shutting down any and all illegal activity, so which crimes exactly will they address themselves to?</p> <p>And how, more importantly, will this new police force be held democratically accountable? At a minimum, the statutes granting central banks remit over monetary policy must be revised to enumerate their new responsibilities. And then the entire relationship of central banks to the electorate will have to change. In their current dispensation, central banks are consciously designed to be minimally beholden to elected officials. It proved too tempting for politicians to instruct central bankers to juice the economy going into election season, so the principle of central bank 'independence' is currently the norm in the democracies.</p> <p>But a law enforcement body cannot be 'independent' of lawmakers. If it is, they are no longer the actual lawmakers: they're democratic furniture decorating the waiting room, while behind closed doors people hired for their grasp of macroeconomics decree laws, enforce them, and sentence those who break them, all in one go.</p> <p>Such a system would mark a fundamental departure from constitutional democracy even if the macroeconomists were perfectly wise and benign rulers. (They won't be.) If we are going to abandon democracy for technocratic oligarchy, we need to have a rather serious discussion about that decision, not sleepwalk into it.</p> <p>Then again, why should we assume they'd be benign, or even competent? Positions of unaccountable power attract people who like wielding unaccountable power. A few years into the introduction of CBDCs, central banks will be staffed by those who want to shape their fellow citizens' behavior in highly intimate ways. They will be ambitious and probably brutal in ways few central bank functionaries are today.</p> <p>The last people who should have full visibility into and control over every transaction are the people who want those things.</p> <h3>High modernism, legibility and control</h3> <p>Speaking of such people, to close this chapter, I'd like to explore the mindset I believe motivates the introduction of CBDCs: the worldview I think will shape their trajectory and, with them, the rest of society's.</p> <p>It's hard not to notice that in much of the foregoing, the individuals and institutions I've been casting as villains have often been associated with the political left. To the extent the left's ideas justify or encourage attacks on the freedom to transact, I have no problem criticizing them on straightforwardly political grounds. Feigning partisan neutrality might make the message of this essay slightly more palatable to a slightly wider slice of the political spectrum, but if that comes at the price of honesty or coherence, I'd rather state the obvious: as I write, left-of-center politicians, business leaders, activists and journalists deserve the bulk of the blame for eroding financial freedoms.</p> <p>That said, much of the legal, institutional and rhetorical groundwork for the rapidly worsening status quo was laid – a mere 20 years ago – by the political right. In the aftermath of 9/11, using terrorist financing as justification, the Bush administration and its allies ratcheted up state surveillance of and interference in the banking system.</p> <p>The KYC/AML infrastructure we live with today owes its existence to a muscular, decidedly right-of-center War on Terror agenda, which included not just financial regulations, but dragnet domestic spying by the NSA; the use of a parallel secret court system to rubber-stamp said spying; and a shocking appetite for indefinite detention without trial, torture and assassination.</p> <p>In that era, the left quite correctly accused the right of violating the letter and spirit of constitutional law. Today the roles are reversed. They'll reverse again in the coming decades, probably more than once.</p> <p>Personally, I see little reason to credit either side with a genuine concern for liberal democratic principles (at least, one that survives more than a couple years in power). I regard the freedom to transact as one more safeguard against whichever side is in the more authoritarian mood today – better yet, against both sides.</p> <p>But bothsidesism is a slender reed, and I don't intend to lean on it. In truth there is an identifiable strain of thought impelling opposition to the freedom to transact. This ideological tribe doesn't cluster reliably in any one region of the left-right spectrum, but it exists, and I'd argue it's at least as coherent and real a faction as those shapeless chimeras <em>the left</em> and <em>the right</em>.</p> <p>This ideology was best described by James C. Scott, who called it 'high modernism.' Here's how he defined the term:</p> <blockquote> <p>'a strong (one might even say muscle-bound) version of the beliefs in scientific and technical progress that were associated with industrialization in Western Europe and in North America from roughly 1830 until World War I. At its center was a supreme self-confidence about continued linear progress, the development of scientific and technical knowledge, the expansion of production, the rational design of social order, the growing satisfaction of human needs, and, not least, an increasing control over nature (including human nature) commensurate with scientific understanding of natural laws.'<sup><a href='#fn130' id='fnref130' epub:type='noteref'>130</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This definition is fine as far as such an abstract description goes, but high modernism is best understood in concrete terms, since there's nothing the high-modernists of the 20th century loved so much as pouring concrete. We can grasp the high-modernist mentality by picturing their favorite project: the planned, rational city.</p> <p>The high-modernist city is large. It is laid out along a rectangular grid, permitting only one non-rectilineal flourish: the huge clover-leaf curves where its mighty 10-lane highways intersect. Its architecture is monumental but unadorned: enormous squares, wide boulevards, imposing brutalist headquarters for ministries and firms (preferably state-owned).</p> <p>Function dictates all spatial division: the city has a district – one – for sleeping (in gargantuan, undifferentiated apartment blocks); a district – one – for office work (drafting grand plans to make society anew); a district – one – for manufacturing (assembly-line factories whose efficiency would dazzle Henry Ford); and a district – one – for leisure (rigorous calisthenics in groups of several hundred, dressed in matching tracksuits, arrayed in a perfect grid).</p> <p>The city should be built from scratch on flat, featureless, virgin land. Failing that, the existing city must be utterly bulldozed and replaced. The high-modernist city makes no accommodations for cultural, geographic or historical accident: it would look the same if it were built in Russia, France, Brazil or India. There being only one rational solution to the problem of how to construct a human city, the setting is unimportant. Any nod to local aesthetic tradition is a misguided concession to parochialism, to semi-feudal darkness. Only the flag flying from the ministries' roofs should concede the existence of human diversity or local history. (And this a reluctant concession.)</p> <p>The high-modernist city shall countenance no ancient quarter, bohemian district, historic center, ethnic enclave, ghetto or bazaar. No winding alleys; no unnamed, nicknamed or unsigned streets. Nothing a highly educated and credentialed servant of the state would decline to include in their blueprint for a freshly built city. That this servant of the state draws up their plans in an office thousands of miles away from the site and employs only the Principles of Municipal Design – remaining perfectly ignorant of the place and its inhabitants as they currently exist – is not an absurdity, but virtuous, modern and scientific.</p> <p>The inhabitants of the city shall all speak the national language (absent a global language). They shall all have first and last names – the ones they were born with and will keep unchanged throughout their lives (antiquated marriage customs permitting). They shall carry standardized identification cards that bear these names, a permanent address (moving is rare and more than a bit suspect) and a serial number uniquely identifying them.</p> <p>They shall learn reading, writing, state-sanctioned history and arithmetic in state-run schools with standardized curricula, their progress measured on standardized tests administered by standardized bureaucrats. They shall work year-round, salaried jobs, for which they're paid on time in the national currency. Their paychecks, with the proper (hefty) taxes withheld, shall be deposited to regulated (better yet, state-owned) banks.</p> <p>The people are uniform. They are interchangeable. They are 'the masses.'</p> <p>When the masses need something (let's not get hung up on wants), they purchase it from a store, whose owner faithfully reports every transaction so that it can be properly taxed. The store holds all necessary licenses from all relevant regulators, whose agents conduct frequent, thorough inspections.</p> <p>The masses do not bribe, barter, gamble, steal, trade on the side, or underreport their tips. They keep their vehicle registrations current. They are strangers to traffic jams, bustling street corners, potholes, graffiti, loud music – to waste, frivolity, stupidity and noncompliance in all its forms.</p> <p>The food they eat comes (via unclogged highways and timely trains) from large, efficient farms employing fertilizers and pesticides produced in the Manufacturing District, seeds optimized by scientists for maximum yield, and workers trained to perform discrete tasks with machine-like efficiency – aided, of course, by shiny machines.</p> <p>There are no peasants on these farms: no one lacking surnames, schooling, papers. No households farming three or four discontinuous strips of land scattered around the village, to which they've been assigned a convoluted form of usufruct by some musty huddle of elders. No household gardens growing jumbles of herbs, no hoards of grain hidden in the rafters or basement. No weird ancient privileges, written down nowhere except perhaps a Latin parchment in the church (which no one can read). No obstacles to the universal application of law and taxation. No manure.</p> <p>High modernism is right angles, the metric system, order, simplicity, standardization. At least, that's the aesthetic its acolytes value. And they sincerely believe that, if this aesthetic is imposed and the dark tangle of tradition and superstition is banished, progress and human flourishing will inevitably result.</p> <p>To no small degree, they have been right. The West and much of the world beyond lives in a version of this dream, and few would turn back the clock.<sup><a href='#fn131' id='fnref131' epub:type='noteref'>131</a></sup> Mass literacy, ample food, clean water, accessible medical care, longer lives and a drastic reduction in day-to-day violence are largely the fruits of such a mindset. But of course, such safety and prosperity are only impressive relative to pre-modern benchmarks. Relative to the only rational benchmark – perfection – modern society has utterly failed its people.</p> <p>Here we encounter the break between modernism – the approach that's drastically improved life in the more prosperous parts of the globe over the last couple of centuries – and its 'muscle-bound' cousin: <em>high</em> modernism elevates rationality from a means to an end in itself. </p> <p>Where modernism values scientific inquiry, high modernism values only its fruits: internal combustion; disease-resistant crops; skyscrapers; gently whirring, chromium-plated machines. Actual scientific inquiry – the process of experimentation, measurement, analysis, and further experimentation – is banished as so much tedious fumbling in the dark. The mindset is strikingly nonempirical, based on a faith in the salvific power of science as an aesthetic, rather than science as a discipline. All has been revealed by the light of Rationality; no need for further inquiry.</p> <p>Scott gives the example of Brasília, one of the few cities in the world to be planned and constructed from scratch according to these principles. The expert who designed it drew inspiration not from any of Brazil's thrumming cosmopolitan centers – nor for that matter from successful modern cities built on grids, like Chicago – but from a completely abstract conception of what the ideal city should look like.</p> <p>The result, when complete, was a lifeless metropolis that afflicted its relatively few residents with what they call 'brasilitis,' a malaise born of vast stretches of asphalt, hulking concrete towers, and none of the energetic street life that characterizes other Brazilian cities. The population of Brasília's metropolitan area did initially grow quickly due to massive internal migration, but the majority settled in satellite cities that grew up organically around the hollow Modern City in the center. These unplanned places, it seems, proved more amenable to the real requirements of human life (and perhaps more importantly, Brazilian life).</p> <p>Over the decades Brasília has partly shed its reputation for oppressive rationality, but the credit is probably due to the compromises its residents have forced on the design: traffic lights, for example, were regarded as unnecessary in a Scientific road system, but were eventually installed anyway.</p> <p>Brasília provides an elegant example of how high modernism can fail on contact with humanity, but in the end it caused more malaise than real suffering. Other high-modernist projects number among the cruelest endeavors in human history.</p> <p>The Bolsheviks were perhaps the quintessential high-modernists: they did not limit their plans to rationalize human society to a field as constrained as municipal architecture. They intended to sweep away all that came before – all that was backward, bourgeois, feudal, capitalist, superstitious, imperialist – and create a society without religion, family, national identity, money, class or government.</p> <p>A handful of skilled administrators would be sufficient to supervise the great farms and factories that would, of their own proletarian accord, produce ample food and clothing for the masses, this homogenous pink goo that would – freed from the benighted structures of pre-socialist stages of development – forget all the old vanities: history, acquisitiveness, God, and love for spouses, parents and children.</p> <p>Most of this vision was so blinkered that it was never even tried. The briefest attempt was made to interpret the hyperinflation that resulted from war, famine and bureaucratic malpractice as a victory: the successful abolition of money.<sup><a href='#fn132' id='fnref132' epub:type='noteref'>132</a></sup> Exuberant plans for the abolition of the family and its associated living arrangements circulated.</p> <p>But Soviet printing presses continued to churn out currency – a lot of currency, then even more – and Bolshevik grandees moved with their wives and children into government-funded apartments that any Muscovite bourgeois family of the Romanov twilight would have envied.<sup><a href='#fn133' id='fnref133' epub:type='noteref'>133</a></sup></p> <p>Even so, a few of the more brutally disruptive plans to usher in the socialist utopia <em>were</em> carried out – to completion, if not with any success. The best example is collectivization. </p> <p>The modernist, to say nothing of the high-modernist, would regard the Russian peasant village with horror. Scott describes the bewildering variety of farming techniques and legal concepts that existed over Russia's vast territory. This was a problem in itself, but to make matters worse, each permutation was downright medieval. (The middle ages ended late in Russia after all: many peasants were legally classed as serfs into the 1860s). A family would cultivate several scattered strips of land, growing different crops here and there, as well as fishing, chopping wood and harvesting other natural resources. Governance was based on oral tradition, simultaneously vague and intricate, flexible and achingly specific.</p> <p>The collective farms formed the sharpest possible contrast to this situation: vast acres of monoculture, tilled by tractors, subject to quotas calculated by the all-seeing center, managed by professional cadres with a deep understanding of scientific socialism (and none of farming).</p> <p>The problem, among others, was that peasants did not want to be forced onto collective farms, which they saw – reasonably enough – as a a return to serfdom on noble estates, or the extension to the civilian realm of the barracks life many had known in World War I and the Civil War. The regime that had sent armed men (sometimes soldiers, sometimes thugs) to take their harvests throughout the long war years was now appropriating their land, relocating them and taking their harvests. Many peasants killed their livestock rather than turn it over to the regime. </p> <p>The regime, in turn, did what high modernists do and applied Theory to the situation, in this case class theory: it identified (or invented) a stratum of rural bourgeoisie, the <em>kulaks</em>, whom it blamed for all resistance and set about murdering en masse. The result of all these policies was not just a shocking tally of injustices against individuals and communities, but famines that killed millions.</p> <p>Can it really be, though, that the Bolshevik regime would starve its own people in the pursuit of aesthetically modern agriculture? It had proved far more flexible in the face of other realities. In its earliest days, the Soviet Union was governed by young men who had spent their lives in prison, Siberian exile, or abroad, waging bitter pamphlet feuds over the fine theoretical points of their scheme to overhaul the world. They had no experience in government, finance, industry or agriculture, and stood no chance of managing – much less radically overhauling – these sectors. For the most part, they accepted this reality and recruited the old regime's bureaucrats and managers to resume their old roles. But agriculture was the exception. In that sphere, the Bolsheviks pushed ahead with a program that wasn't even central to Marx's thinking.</p> <p>The reason was that the Soviet regime desperately needed to establish control over the peasantry. First, the peasantry represented the vast majority of the population. Second, the Bolsheviks were barely able to feed the cities. In previous years they'd resorted to forced requisitions of grain from the countryside. But repeatedly invading the hostile hinterland was not a sustainable solution. Looked at from this angle, collectivization was not a reform measure, but a brutal and decisive strategy employed in a civil war waged by the urban regime against the peasantry.</p> <p>Collective farms, while they did produce (some) food, were as much concentration camps designed to intern a rebellious population as they were farms.</p> <p>Collectivization was a means of rationalizing the agricultural sector, but not in order to increase crop yields. The goal was to take a scattered, diverse people living according to a welter of local rules – always unwritten and always baroque in their complexity – and subject them to a single system. The <em>kolkhoz</em> (collective farm) standardized the peasants, making them 'legible,' in Scott's term, and therefore controllable. If millions of them died in the process, that was – at least to Stalin's thinking – beside the point.</p> <p>Other authoritarian regimes in the socialist tradition have repeated the same <em>mistakes</em> as Stalin, not because – or not exclusively because – they'd convinced themselves that a systematized, high-modernist approach to agriculture would lead to prosperity, but because they found a complex, scattered, variegated peasantry to be deeply threatening. In China, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and elsewhere, the goal has been to create a uniform, visible populace, onto which order can be enforced and from which resources can be appropriated.</p> <p>How can a government – particularly one based, at least ostensibly, on central planning – know how much food it can expect to produce if, ten miles outside its capital, there are no records of how much land is cultivated, what's grown on it, who's doing the growing, or even who <em>who </em>is? </p> <p>Peasant identity does not map to bureaucratic identity. 'Will' is not a satisfactory persona in the state's eyes, even if he's the only Will in the village, which he won't be. <em>Will, John's son</em> is a step in the right direction (better make that 'William Johnson'), though there's no way of knowing whether he's the same person as Will the tailor ('William Taylor') or short Will ('William Short'), so called for his prodigious height. When was this person born? Where? Where does he live, what is his wife's name, and does he own a horse or mule we can requisition for the spring campaign?</p> <p>Such an unknowable mass is not a reliable producer of food for the factories and army, or for that matter recruiting ground for workers and soldiers. Worse, it's potentially rebellious, since sending soldiers and factory workers (back) to take its harvest seems to enrage it to no end.</p> <p>Western Europe required centuries to impose a measure of bureaucratic order on its peasantry. Since the communists were making the world anew anyway, they felt it would be easier to uproot, relocate and enumerate the whole lot all at once.</p> <p>This approach isn't limited to leftist revolutionaries. Western colonial regimes have imposed many equally violent transitions into modernity. The United States fenced in the nomadic native peoples of the plains, subjected them to censuses, made them cut their hair and learn the national language, and killed the majority of them, directly or by driving them to despair. The apartheid regime carried out a similar program in South Africa. Independent Tanzania's collectivization ('villagization') push drew ideological inspiration from Stalin and Mao, but if one didn't know that, it would be easy to see it as a simple continuation of British colonial policy.</p> <p>Again, for the purposes of this analysis, the urge to assign political valences (left, right, imperialist, revolutionary) to the states carrying out these programs is probably a distraction. Any sufficiently powerful state, confronted with a population it cannot adequately surveil, will undertake shockingly violent measures in order to gain that capacity – in order to make it legible. Even where the government is not a foreign colonizer convinced of its racial superiority, but indigenous, as in China, Russia, Tanzania or Ethiopia, the results are horrific.</p> <p>Returning to our vision of the high-modernist city and its perfectly behaved, quota-exceeding masses: how are the authorities supposed to manifest their rational utopia when the masses refuse to conform to the grid? Real people steal, get drunk, gamble, do drugs, study art history instead of engineering, obtain illegal weapons, then kill each other with them. They bribe officials, refuse to send their kids to approved schools, clump together in neighborhoods with others who refuse to speak the national language. They decline to report earnings, decline to register their vehicles. They join unions and churches and gangs. They refuse vaccines.</p> <p>To control these irrational impulses – to force the fractal, turbulent forces of normal human behavior onto the high-modernist grid – the state must first locate infractions: it must know who is doing what, where and when. And to know such things reliably at scale, it must surveil the entire populace closely.<br /> </p> <p>'An illegible society,' Scott writes, 'is a hindrance to any effective intervention by the state, whether the purpose of that intervention is plunder or public welfare.' In contrast, 'a thoroughly legible society […] creates a kind of national transparency through the uniformity of codes, identities, statistics, regulations, and measures.'<sup><a href='#fn134' id='fnref134' epub:type='noteref'>134</a></sup></p> <p>To illustrate the sinister turn enhanced state capacity through enhanced legibility can take, Scott includes a map of Amsterdam compiled by the municipality in collaboration with the occupying Nazis. It shows in stark detail the distribution of the city's Jewish population in 1941, each of the countless tiny dots representing ten Jewish individuals. Crucially, this data was not compiled exclusively by the Nazis. It drew heavily on the 'exceptionally comprehensive' census data gathered by the pre-invasion government of the Netherlands. The presumably benign motivations behind the original data collection did nothing to constrain the later use of that data by a malignant state.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the right to transact. While at least one high-modernist state of the 20th century briefly contemplated abolishing money, none attempted to track its every movement – how could they? In an analog world, it was no more practical to record every economic exchange than it would be to record every spoken word.<sup><a href='#fn135' id='fnref135' epub:type='noteref'>135</a></sup></p> <p>The authorities would certainly be on the lookout for suspicious exchanges of any kind – of value or sentiment – and their spy networks could be brutally effective in this regard. But to automate the process, to sit by and let passively collected, comprehensive data flow into centralized repositories for analysis? Such wondrous legibility was unthinkable until now. To say nothing of the ability to censor economic exchanges in real time and reverse them by fiat after the fact.</p> <p>The high-modernist states of the 2020s and 2030s will absolutely pursue this means of rendering their populations legible and controllable, if permitted to do so. It will matter very little what sort of rhetoric the politicians at their heads use in justification: nationalist, anti-racist, racist, environmentalist, socialist or theocratic. Any of these, so long as it claims a monopoly on truth, is perfectly compatible with the jealous paranoia of the all-seeing police state.</p> <p>Nor does the initial justification for adopting these capabilities determine – or even constrain – the uses to which they'll later be put. The Dutch constitutional monarchy of the early 20th century was simply doing what any respectable European state of the era would: collecting data on its population. Whatever its motives for learning the address of every Jewish household in Amsterdam, they weren't genocidal. No matter: the Nazis put the data to their own use.</p> <h2>Cryptocurrency protects the right to transact</h2> <p><em>I'm sorry that your warrantless surveillance regime was built on the assumption that people would always need intermediaries to transact.</em></p> <p>Neeraj K. Agrawal</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As I write, cryptocurrency is as popular and as unpopular as it's ever been. A few short years ago, bitcoin – there was nothing to speak of but bitcoin – was the hobby of a vanishingly small niche centered around Mises-reading C programmers. Those who were familiar with it and did not fit the above description knew it as the coin of the Silk Road, a dark web marketplace where every manner of drug and a few even-more-illegal goods and services were on offer.</p> <p>Few normal people, even if they'd admit to having bought MDMA with bitcoin, could tell you how it worked or why it was created. (This is painfully obvious in retrospect, given how many people assured me around that time that bitcoin was 'completely private.') To know about bitcoin, much less to share such knowledge at parties, marked one out as a weirdo: a Mises reader, if not a C programmer. Even so, by late 2013, the price was on a parabolic run, and knowledge of its existence was beginning to move in from the margins.</p> <p>Then the sole bitcoin exchange, MtGox, imploded in a spectacular hack or spectacular fraud, or perhaps both, and the fun was over for a few years.</p> <p>By 2017, bitcoin's inert digital gold had been joined by a Turing-complete blockchain platform, ethereum, where developers could create new digital coins and imbue them with logic of arbitrary complexity. They mostly opted for making extravagant promises based on this exciting prospect and monetizing the paradigm shift in advance – well in advance – through 'initial coin offerings' (ICOs). The vast majority of the ICO tokens went to zero: many issuers were simply scammers, many others were earnest and more or less competent, but ultimately unsuccessful. A few projects from that era have survived and created enormous value for early investors, but none had an easy go of it.</p> <p><em>Crypto</em> – the world beyond, but originating from, bitcoin – was making tentative inroads more or less everywhere. By 2018 few people exposed to mass media had <em>no</em> idea what crypto was. And a not-insignificant portion of the population, in some countries at least, had access to exchanges where they could purchase the assets. The size of the market had achieved thrilling new highs: bitcoin rivaled the market capitalization of major investment banks – briefly.</p> <p>But a deep and not-unjustified suspicion had set in. Internet hucksters had promised to recreate Uber, Google and Facebook, but better, global, <em>decentralized</em> – and what did that mean anyway? They'd taken investment capital (not from VCs, but from hordes of blinkered retail investors), and in many cases simply disappeared with it. Meanwhile a few highly visible, extremely grating internet personalities were flaunting their Lamborghinis, promising that you too could ride the magical infinite money wave to riches. Not to mention the shocking amount of electricity that 'mining' these fake internet coins consumed.</p> <p>It was hard not to hate the whole thing.</p> <p>A couple years after the bubble burst, not just the ICO tokens but bitcoin and ethereum themselves seemed to be headed for zero, until in 2020 and 2021, a confluence of factors set off another crypto mania.</p> <p>First was the creation of decentralized finance ('defi'), a suite of applications of the sort the ICO founders had promised, but mostly failed, to build. A number of these, including a couple class-of-2017 projects, had gone live – and they worked. Users could borrow, lend and trade tokens on-chain, without resorting to centralized exchanges. The second factor was a massive influx of easy money: central banks and governments the world over flooded markets with stimulus and interest-free loans in an attempt to fight off the covid-induced depression many feared.</p> <p>History repeated itself, but this time at another order of magnitude. Crypto wasn't just plastered across tech and finance blogs, but every major outlet. No longer the province of long-forgotten child actors and retired athletes, crypto scams secured the endorsements of the world's sparkliest celebrities. After a year or so the defi money machines faded from focus, but the 'ethereum-killers' (alternative blockchains promising faster or cheaper execution) stepped in, along with non-fungible tokens or NFTs (latter-day ICOs with jpegs attached), which made extravagant promises to build groundbreaking video games and global luxury brands, but mostly nose-dived to zero after an (optional) initial pump.</p> <p>Exchanges reached unheard-of dimensions: one, FTX, bought naming rights to a stadium, Super Bowl ad time, a herd of journalists and not a few politicians – before collapsing as the result of fraud more egregious and megalomaniacal than anything the industry had seen before. Which is saying something.</p> <p>As I write, the late bull market is a recent, painful memory, so I won't go into every grisly detail. Suffice it to say that the most recent crypto boom brought awareness of the phenomenon to give or take every corner of the globe, swelling the sector until it rivaled the largest companies in the world in market capitalization. Crypto is more popular than ever.</p> <p>And yet it is more hated than it's ever been. Critics hate it for the energy wasted, in their view, by bitcoin mining (ethereum, which for most of its history was mined similarly to bitcoin, no longer uses large quantities of electricity, but not everyone knows that). They hate it for being, in their view, a Ponzi scheme, a giant fraud whereby hordes of starry-eyed new entrants pay for earlier entrants' Miami condos. They hate the dog coins. (These are like bitcoin, but with dog names and logos. Now there are also frog coins. Exciting.)</p> <p>They hate the hacks that drain tens of billions of dollars from applications they've never heard of and can't fathom the point of – then used to fund, and this is not a joke, North Korea's nuclear weapons program.<sup><a href='#fn136' id='fnref136' epub:type='noteref'>136</a></sup> They hate the vapid, smug slogans – <em>we're all gonna make it</em> – that vapid, smug people with erstwhile $100,000 NFT profile pictures recite back and forth to each other. And though they'll never admit it, they hate that these people made all that money and not them.</p> <h3>Cryptocurrency works</h3> <p>Fair enough. But I disagree with anyone who concludes that the thick layer of slime crypto accumulates in every bull market (and never completely washes off in the bear markets) defines or invalidates the technology.</p> <p>Bitcoin, ethereum and some others<sup><a href='#fn137' id='fnref137' epub:type='noteref'>137</a></sup> do what they were designed to do, successfully and reliably. If you manage to obtain and properly self-custody these assets, no one can confiscate them from you or stop you from spending or otherwise making use of them within the bounds of the relevant protocol. They are permissionless, censorship-resistant, non-confiscatable assets.</p> <p>A small but dedicated clutch of cryptographers and computer scientists spent decades trying to create these sorts of assets. Decentralized digital cash proved to be a difficult problem. Cryptographic primitives developed in the 20th century allowed for the secure transfer of information, but transferring value was a different story. You can send the same encrypted message twice without degrading or devaluing its contents; at worst, you'll mildly annoy the recipient. But if you're able to send the same $100 twice, then it's not $100, is it? It's more like $0. Any protocol that behaves this way can't serve as money.</p> <p>A piece of paper can't be copied and pasted – that is, not trivially: counterfeiting cash is hard. Digital information can, so translating money into digital information requires a solution to this issue, what's called the 'double-spend' problem.<sup><a href='#fn138' id='fnref138' epub:type='noteref'>138</a></sup> Early attempts at building cryptographically secure money relied on a centralized referee – usually called a 'bank' – that would ensure no participant in the network tried to spend the same money twice. This was hardly satisfactory, though: whoever controls the bank controls the network, so why build such a protocol at all? Why not just keep your money – which certainly by the 21st century was digital anyway – at Bank of America or Chase?</p> <p>Bitcoin solved this problem. The specifics of how it did so are fascinating, to me at least, but would require a long digression into the basics of cryptography that not all readers are likely to find worth their while.</p> <p>Less important than how it works is <em>that</em> it works. More than a decade into the bitcoin experiment, we know that it does: no one has yet been able to confiscate anyone's bitcoin or censor a bitcoin transaction. A multibillion-dollar bug bounty is waiting for someone clever or well-resourced enough to crack it, and no one has managed.</p> <p>In fact, the multibillion-dollar price tag probably understates the incentive for some actors. Major governments and big banks face no challenge to the monetary status quo quite as direct and tenacious as crypto. I'm not sure how one would price the ability to take it off the board – but I imagine it would be in the trillions.</p> <p>And yet no one has. China, a military, technological and economic superpower, is deeply hostile to crypto: it's essentially banned crypto outright<sup><a href='#fn139' id='fnref139' epub:type='noteref'>139</a></sup> – though its long series of crackdowns<sup><a href='#fn140' id='fnref140' epub:type='noteref'>140</a></sup> is itself an indication that the ban is ineffective. If it were able to, wouldn't the government have simply confiscated its citizens' bitcoin, or attacked the protocol itself, rendering the network useless and the asset worthless?</p> <p>I submit that it would have, if it could. Decentralized censorship-resistant money would make even the most libertarian government (whatever that might look like) sweat. But for a state as authoritarian as China, it's anathema.</p> <p>Even if the CCP had forsworn such extreme measures for some reason, or found it in its interest to let the crypto experiment run, some other powerful, motivated actor would have pulled the trigger by now. It's not even necessary to envision mass confiscation or a total crippling of the network: if it were possible to force or block the transfer of bitcoin, a court somewhere would have ordered it done – or rather, been able to enforce such an order. This hasn't happened. No single actor can order the bitcoin network to perform or desist from any action.</p> <p>Of course, it's still possible to threaten a person with incarceration or violence if they don't hand over their bitcoin. No technology yet devised can obviate that attack vector. It's also possible to take someone's assets by obtaining their secret key through whatever means, including ones that can be highly difficult to defend against. To take someone's secret key is to take their crypto; the network doesn't know or care who has the 'right' to a given sum of tokens, it only cares who can sign a transaction with the correct key. </p> <p>For this reason, it's easy to take someone's assets when they're held by a third-party custodian, such as an exchange: from the protocol's perspective, those aren't the customer's assets in any meaningful sense, but the exchange's – indistinguishable from any other assets controlled by the same private keys. So the exchange can abscond with them at any time, as happens not infrequently.</p> <p>But if we accept the radical nature of crypto ownership – that it is a bearer asset, period – we can see that no one has ever stopped someone else's crypto transaction from going through, and no one has ever performed a transaction on someone else's behalf (in other words, confiscated their crypto).</p> <p>How important is this achievement in practice, given that you're still ultimately vulnerable to extortion and threats of physical violence? I'd argue, immensely. Banks can no longer disappear with your savings: there is no need to trust your assets to a custodian. The state can no longer simply order your assets frozen or seized: they will have to actually come and take them, giving you time and room to flee.</p> <p>Americans in particular may scoff at this notion, but they shouldn't: if their own grandparents didn't board a steamship to the New World with only the jewelry they could hide on their person to build a new life with, many other people's grandparents did.</p> <p>And more prosaically, crypto renders impotent all those creeping limitations on people's ability to purchase legal goods and services. The centralized service handling your payment might not let you buy some pornographic media; it might flag your purchase of a firearm; if PayPal had had its way, it might even fine you for saying something it doesn't agree with. None of this is possible with bitcoin. The U.S. government couldn't stop people from paying for controlled substances with bitcoin on the Silk Road: it had to find the people running the service and physically take them into custody.</p> <p>So when governments, commercial banks, central banks and their allies in the media sneer at crypto's claims of decentralization, they are lying to you if not to themselves. Some of their specific critiques are well-founded, if exaggerated, but to the extent they imply that crypto fails at censorship resistance, they're simply false.</p> <p>Occasionally, a government believes its own propaganda, with amusing results. When the Canadian government debanked protesters in response to what it called 'illegal blockades' in 2022,<sup><a href='#fn141' id='fnref141' epub:type='noteref'>141</a></sup> it was surprised to find that bitcoin did in fact do what its proponents claimed. The authorities were able to freeze bank and payment app accounts with a stern word to the relevant businesses. But when they ordered several cryptocurrency wallets to be frozen, they met with mixed success.<sup><a href='#fn142' id='fnref142' epub:type='noteref'>142</a></sup> To the extent the order required exchanges and other centralized businesses to treat these accounts as untouchable, it could be enforced.</p> <p>But to the extent it tried to halt the use of self-custodied crypto, it was a risible failure. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice demanded that several entities freeze crypto addresses and provide information on the owners of these addresses. Among these 'intermediaries,' as the February 15 order called the entities, was at least one non-custodial bitcoin wallet provider, Nunchuk.<sup><a href='#fn143' id='fnref143' epub:type='noteref'>143</a></sup> In an email sent to the court and posted on Twitter, Nunchuk explained why it couldn't comply:</p> <blockquote> <p>'Nunchuk is a self-custodial, collaborative-multisig Bitcoin wallet. We are a software provider, not a financial intermediary.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'Our software is free to use. It allows people to eliminate single points of failures [sic] and store bitcoin in the safest way possible, while preserving privacy.<br /> <br /> 'We do not collect any user identification information beyond email addresses. We also do not hold any keys. Therefore:<br /> </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We cannot 'freeze' our users' assets.</li> <li>We cannot 'prevent' them from being moved.</li> <li>We do not have knowledge of 'the existence, nature, value, and location' of our users' assets. This is by design.</li> </blockquote> </ul> <blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>'Please look up how self custody and private keys work. When the Canadian dollar becomes worthless, we will be here to serve you, too.'<sup><a href='#fn144' id='fnref144' epub:type='noteref'>144</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Once the realization that bitcoin can in fact function without intermediaries sank in, Canadian authorities found they had few options: the Ontario Securities Commission fell back to censoring speech, since their colleagues in the province's courts were unable to censor transactions. They reported tweets by Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, which advocated the use of non-custodial wallets, to the police.<sup><a href='#fn145' id='fnref145' epub:type='noteref'>145</a></sup> (Both Kraken and Coinbase are centralized, custodial crypto exchanges which would in principle be forced to comply with orders to freeze accounts.)</p> <p>Given that the above tweets are still accessible through a Canadian VPN server at the time of writing, it seems this attempt at censorship was also unsuccessful.</p> <p>A couple other examples will help demonstrate that crypto's censorship resistance is not illusory. When Russia outlawed donations to Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, the prominent dissident urged his followers to donate using cryptocurrency.<sup><a href='#fn146' id='fnref146' epub:type='noteref'>146</a></sup> At the time of writing, the organization's website still lists addresses for several crypto networks, and judging by public blockchain data, the addresses continue to receive donations unimpeded.<sup><a href='#fn147' id='fnref147' epub:type='noteref'>147</a></sup></p> <p>The Russian state employs world-class hackers. Having actually poisoned Navalny, it would presumably have no qualms about seizing or freezing his organization's crypto assets. It doesn't because it's unable to.</p> <p>The ways around crypto's censorship resistance, as I mentioned earlier, are violence, physical intimidation and extortion. Cryptographers refer to a '$5 wrench' attack: there may be no known technical vector to crack someone's perfect encryption scheme, but if you can take a wrench to their face and hands while demanding the password, that doesn't matter.</p> <p>The Venezuelan state has adopted this philosophy in its battle against cryptocurrency users in the country. Venezuela is run by one of the world's least-competent socialist governments, and in the late 2010s the country was experiencing a profound economic crisis, characterized by severe shortages of food and medicine, blackouts, hyperinflation, and massive emigration. Seeing themselves as locked in an anti-imperialist struggle with the United States, the government banned the use of the dollar.</p> <p>As a result, Venezuela became one of the few places in the world ever to experience widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a day-to-day means of payment.<sup><a href='#fn148' id='fnref148' epub:type='noteref'>148</a></sup> The bolívar was worthless; dollars were unobtainable; but bitcoin – which could be mined using heavily subsidized, albeit intermittently available, electricity – could be gotten and used without the state's approval.</p> <p>The state soon expressed its displeasure, however.<sup><a href='#fn149' id='fnref149' epub:type='noteref'>149</a></sup> Its motives were twofold: first, ordinary Venezuelans were skirting the ban on dollars, or doing something that, to the police, sounded close enough (law is a fluid thing under Maduro); and second, elites in the security services – whose other sidelines include drug trafficking – wanted the bitcoin for themselves. The secret police arrested miners, accused them of vague offenses, confiscated their equipment (and presumably their bitcoin, in cases where the keys were stored on miners' computers) and used the hardware to mine bitcoin themselves.</p> <p>Crypto, used in isolation, is ineffective against physical force. Firearms can deliver promising results in this regard, but that's another topic.<sup><a href='#fn150' id='fnref150' epub:type='noteref'>150</a></sup></p> <p>I should clarify an additional point: as mentioned above, North Korea has managed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency. How is that consistent with my contention that no one – even nation states – can freeze or confiscate crypto? The answer is that North Korea is attacking not the base protocol (in most cases ethereum), but applications built on top of it.</p> <p>Let's say I build a lending and borrowing application on ethereum, but through an unfortunate oversight, I fail to properly secure a critical function in the smart contract. It should be the case that only the owner of a certain sum of collateral can call the <code>withdrawCollateral</code> function, but I've made a mistake that allows anyone to do so. A hacker – they could be anyone, but let's say they happen to be serving in the North Korean military – notices the vulnerability and starts withdrawing random users' collateral, netting a few million dollars.</p> <p>The ethereum protocol was not compromised. The hacker can't take these users' ether if it's just sitting in their wallet, or in any properly secured smart contract. They can only steal from my users because I've created an application allowing them to do so. We don't blame the C programming language, integrated circuits, the von Neumann architecture, or computing in general when buggy software causes a problem – even a catastrophic one. In almost every case, the software ran as written, the hardware behaved as instructed; the problem was in the instructions.<sup><a href='#fn151' id='fnref151' epub:type='noteref'>151</a></sup></p> <p>Alright then, enough about governments. What about exchanges? Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates stole something like $8 billion of their customers' crypto. How did they manage that?</p> <p>The answer is brutally simple: it was never their crypto. Morally, ethically, legally and by the common consent of all humankind, those assets belonged to the users who had purchased them. But according to the blockchain, they belonged to the person in control of their associated private keys: Sam and his colleagues.</p> <p><em>Not your keys, not your coins</em>, is the mantra that advocates of self-custody repeat.</p> <p>But whereas customers of a bank can't realistically take their life savings out in cash and 'self-custody' fiat currency that way (as I mentioned above, this is for all practical purposes illegal in the U.S. and much of Europe), customers of crypto exchanges can and should do just that. Unless you plan to trade it in the near term, there's no reason to keep a large amount of crypto on a centralized exchange. Empirically, they can't be trusted, and because the technology enables – <em>exists</em> to enable – self-custody, there's no need to trust them. </p> <p>Custodying your own crypto assets and keeping them safe from hackers, governments and government hackers may not be simple. In some cases, it might be infeasible. But it is possible in principle. No other asset allows you to do that, unless it's cash, diamonds or gold. And cash, diamonds and gold fall short of crypto in a couple key respects. They can't be instantly sent across the world. They can't be memorized: if you need to cross an especially hostile border, you can do so with your life savings stored in twelve words in your head.<sup><a href='#fn152' id='fnref152' epub:type='noteref'>152</a></sup></p> <p>Nor, as any added bonus, do the spatial dimensions of crypto scale with the value. You can store $50 or $500 million in the same USB stick, or using the same twelve words. You can't hide $500 million of gold in your suitcase or sew $500 million of gemstones into the lining of your clothes.</p> <h3>Privacy and cryptocurrency</h3> <p>Up to this point, I've skirted around an important topic; likely you've noticed. Cash grants its users basically unparalleled freedom to transact, for two reasons. First, it's physical. If some third party wants to censor your cash transaction, they'll need to be literally in the room with you. Second, it's anonymous. Unless your circumstances are exceedingly unique, you don't need to worry about marked bills.</p> <p>Crypto isn't physical. This fact introduces complications like the risk of hacking, but it's also an advantage. You can send it across the world in seconds; cash, less so. And as I argued above, crypto achieves censorship resistance in spite of the drawbacks of being digital.</p> <p>The other way crypto is unlike cash – and this is more of a problem – is that it isn't anonymous. For this reason, despite its obvious relevance to the right to transact, I've hardly discussed privacy.</p> <p>There's a historical reason for the lack of anonymity in crypto (or rather, in bitcoin and ethereum; other protocols confer better privacy). Satoshi Nakamoto solved the double-spend problem by creating a completely public ledger of all transactions. We can't exactly fault him (?): the problem had bested cryptographers for decades, and his solution enabled a decentralized network of miners to validate the ledger, dispensing with the trusted 'bank' at the center of the protocol. But this design came at the cost of privacy.</p> <p>In certain respects then, crypto marks a step backwards from cash. Without privacy, would-be censors can follow the precedent set by the Venezuelan secret police: find you, arrest you, and render your supposed freedom to transact null. We might question whether censorship resistance can truly exist in the absence of privacy.</p> <p>I don't have a clean answer to that question, and I won't wave it away. But I'll argue that, even if crypto sacrifices some of the advantages of cash, we shouldn't act as if there's some other, better option waiting in the wings, conveniently providing censorship resistance, privacy and the ability to transact at distances of more than literal arm's length.</p> <p>After all, cash's censorship resistance comes with a massive caveat: the state can demonetize some or all of the paper bills it's issued, any time it wants.</p> <p>The government can replace these now-worthless bills with new ones, backed by its full-if-conditional faith and credit, or it can simply not. 'Cashless society' is a favorite slogan of supranational policy organs like the IMF and WEF.<sup><a href='#fn153' id='fnref153' epub:type='noteref'>153</a></sup> The U.S., as detailed earlier, has made operating in cash all but illegal for businesses. And it's not as if no major economy would be crazy enough to pursue mass demonetization: India did it less than a decade ago.</p> <p>Governments may not be able to censor it all that well, but the fact remains that cash is issued by governments, and as such, subject to their whims. Crypto isn't.</p> <p>To be clear, I don't mean to frame cash and crypto as rivals. We don't need to pick one or the other. I'm emphatically in favor of retaining if not expanding cash's role in society, while expanding crypto's. But ideally we're able to rely exclusively on crypto, given the risk that governments remove physical cash from circulation.</p> <p>I'll pause here to address a potential source of confusion, because many people think that bitcoin and ethereum <em>are</em> in fact private, and that that's sort of their point. This impression is correct in the sense that you don't transact under your full name, permanent address, driver's license number <em>and we need one additional form of ID – do you have a current lease or voter registration card?</em><br /> <br /> You don't need to provide any information to open an account, which is just a string of letters and numbers. The numbers and letters themselves convey nothing. Here's an example:<sup><a href='#fn154' id='fnref154' epub:type='noteref'>154</a></sup> </p> <code>0xd5e099c71B797516c10ED0F0d895f429C2781142</code> <p><code>d5e09</code> is anonymous, except, not really. Since their entire transaction history can be parsed and analyzed, they're open to identification through any number of techniques, by any number of parties, till Judgment Day. Can some random online sleuth figure out who <code>d5e09</code> is today? Probably not. (Although I've seen it done.) </p> <p>Can the state? Almost certainly. And if not today, then soon. How did <code>d5e09</code> fund their wallet? If they bought from a centralized exchange, game over. The exchange has already shared their information with the government, or soon will. Does <code>d5e09</code> file taxes? Then they've given enough information about their crypto activity to identify their wallet and establish the link. </p> <p>Even if they obtained their crypto anonymously (by mining it, buying it with cash, stealing it, faking their KYC or using a no-KYC exchange), sooner or later they'll connect their wallet to some site that logs their IP address, links it to their wallet address, and sends both to the FBI in a nice CSV the first stern email they get.</p> <p>Let's say <code>d5e09</code> is too careful for any of that to work. They'll transact with some account that's less careful. Each address the state identifies, the smaller the anonymous portion of the network becomes, and the bigger the 'doxxed' (personally identified) portion grows. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: the remaining pieces get easier and easier to place. Remember also that the blockchain never expires. </p> <p>If you're still confident you have the operational security needed to stay anonymous, congratulations. For you, crypto is private. For most people, it's anything but.</p> <p>There is hope. I said earlier that we shouldn't act as though there's some additional option, neither cash nor bitcoin/ethereum but a secret third thing that's digital, private and censorship-resistant. </p> <p>But perhaps there is: crypto is more than just bitcoin and ethereum. Several protocols exist that let you transact in private, the most popular at the time of writing being Monero and Zcash. But good luck – unless you happen to be an expert in cryptography – deciding which privacy coin, if any, is private enough for your needs. Rumor and innuendo stalk this corner of the industry, with supporters of each technology decrying their rivals as compromised in one way or another, and vice-versa.<br /> <br /> Often enough, the critics hold deeply underwater speculative investments in their chosen coin, and know only what fellow bagholders on Reddit have told them to believe about the evil Other Coins. But dismiss the fear, uncertainty and doubt at your own peril. In 2022 the developers of Secret, another prominent privacy coin, disclosed a vulnerability that threatened the anonymity of users' transactions. No users were affected by the attack vector, they said, which white hat hackers alerted them to in time.<sup><a href='#fn155' id='fnref155' epub:type='noteref'>155</a></sup> </p> <p>But what if the NSA finds your vulnerability first? The NSA doesn't disclose these things. It uses them. So do any number of similarly resourced organizations around the world.<br /> <br /> I don't want to take a side in any Zcash-Monero beef, and I don't want to imply that Secret or anyone else is being owned unawares. I simply want to illustrate how hard it is for those seeking privacy in crypto. </p> <p>Particularly if you <em>need</em> privacy – if you're not just libertarian, but someone the state is specifically interested in identifying and neutralizing – the outlook is bleak. Governments go to extreme measures and play an absurdly long game when it comes to this sort of thing. For decades Crypto AG was the world's premier vendor of encrypted communication products. Israel bought its equipment, as did Egypt, Iran, Argentina and around 100 other countries. It was secretly owned by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who listened to any customer conversation it pleased and charged the victims millions for the privilege.<sup><a href='#fn156' id='fnref156' epub:type='noteref'>156</a></sup></p> <p>With that kind of precedent, how much research do you need to do on a privacy protocol before you can feel safe using it?</p> <p>Not that we should hold cryptocurrency to a higher standard than other technology. Privacy is basically impossible to guarantee in any digital communication. (<em>Gestures expansively toward Snowden revelations.</em>) Where the state takes a sincere interest in what you're saying or how you're spending your money, you should probably assume they know or will find out.</p> <p>Occasionally something happens that gives me some confidence the state can't crack a piece of privacy tech: they ban it. Perhaps Tornado Cash, which I'll explain in detail below, really did stump government sleuths. Not that I'd bet money on it, and not that it would be much comfort. If you're under American jurisdiction – which if you ask American courts, basically everyone is – you could face decades in prison for using Tornado Cash.</p> <p>Still, new innovations are arriving faster than the Treasury can sanction them, and the push to bring privacy to the base layer of ethereum is gathering steam. With any luck, the problem of privacy in crypto becomes much less acute over the next few years. And even if it doesn't, crypto still allows you to transact without permission or interference. You might just have to do so publicly.</p> <h3>Permissionlessness and its discontents</h3> <p>With any luck I've convinced you that crypto succeeds in its core purpose of censorship resistance.</p> <p>But that's not the same as convincing you that crypto is <em>worth it</em>. What about all the other promises people have made about crypto: that it would fix remittances, destroy the Federal Reserve, bank the unbanked, end ad-funded social media through micropayments, something about 'the metaverse' – that it would make us all rich?</p> <p>I can't speak to any of the many promises people make about crypto, except the one. The technology may yet accomplish some or all of the above. Personally I doubt it manages more than one or two, if that. Crypto was built to do one thing, and it does it well.</p> <p>Why then must we put up with all this empty hype and the scams and Ponzi schemes it gives rise to? Is censorship resistance worth the hurricane of snake oil? You're free to decide it's not. (I would of course disagree with you.) But it's important to understand why we can't have one without the other.</p> <p>Recall the <em>bank</em> that early attempts to create cryptographically secured digital currency relied on: a trusted, centralized intermediary. None of these protocols ever enjoyed any level of adoption, because they had no reason to exist. We can already send money electronically by relying on a trusted, centralized intermediary. To remove the single point of failure – the referee who could rob you, turn authoritarian, prove incompetent or betray your trust in any number of other ways – the protocol needed to be entirely decentralized and permissionless.</p> <p>Crypto is <em>permissionless</em> because anyone is allowed to help maintain it by validating new transactions (in bitcoin this is known as 'mining') – even criminals and dictators and heretics of every stripe. No one needs to be granted permission, because that requirement presupposes an authority to do the granting: a central point of failure, a bank.</p> <p>To take control of the bitcoin network and deny someone's ability to transact, more than 50% of the miners (measured by computing power) would need to collude. This could happen, but it hasn't yet, and given that no one can keep anyone out of the network based on any criteria but the ability to run software compatible with the protocol, the risk seems manageable.</p> <p>And since anyone can validate new transactions, anyone can transact. A particular miner might decline to process your transaction, for whatever reason. No matter, another one will process it within seconds or perhaps, depending on the network, minutes. This means censorship resistance, and censorship resistance means scams.</p> <p>People are excited about cryptocurrency. It's new, it's growing rapidly, it's made people rich. They were excited about tech stocks in the 90s, bonds in the 80s, any and all stocks in the 20s, railroads in the 1840s, the South Sea Company in 1720. People get excited about novel financial opportunities, and when they do, unscrupulous people make extravagant promises that end up irradiating the funds of those greedy or gullible enough to trust them.</p> <p>If crypto were a permissioned system, it might be possible to keep the scammers out – not that existing permissioned financial platforms, like stock exchanges, have a shining track record in this regard. But if crypto were a permissioned system, it would not exist. It would have no purpose.</p> <p>You might object: censorship resistance doesn't just enable Ponzis and pump-and-dumps, but more serious wrongdoing: tax evasion, drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, terrorist financing and more.</p> <p>First of all, compared to the legacy financial system, it really doesn't – not yet, anyway. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm that counts multiple government agencies among its clients, illicit transactions accounted for just 0.24% of cryptocurrency transactions by volume in 2022. In absolute terms, that's $20.6 billion – not nothing, but paltry in both relative and absolute terms, when you compare it to the fiat world.<sup><a href='#fn157' id='fnref157' epub:type='noteref'>157</a></sup> The Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade puts the figure for overall worldwide illicit trade at 8-15% of global GDP – several trillion dollars.<sup><a href='#fn158' id='fnref158' epub:type='noteref'>158</a></sup> </p> <p>Even so, I can accept that crypto is theoretically suitable for money laundering and tax evasion. (Ignoring the fact that most protocols commit every transaction to a transparent, permanent, public ledger, which seems inconvenient.) As crypto's role in the economy grows, I have little doubt, so will its role in the illicit economy. And none of the criminal or otherwise antisocial behavior that bitcoin and the like might enable should simply be waved away.</p> <h3>The regulatory agenda</h3> <p>But accepting that premise, what do those who would surveil and control – or as they put it, 'regulate' – the crypto market wish to accomplish? Would they clean up this market the way they have the world's most highly regulated banks? As we've seen, those institutions clean and hide torrents of criminal proceeds from the tax authorities, no less today than five or ten regulatory crackdowns ago.</p> <p>Speaking of which, what do these crackdowns entail? Politicians denounce the big banks for their role in financial malfeasance. And they propose a solution: to tighten up financial regulations, that is, to require that more paperwork be filed on what the rules call <em>suspicious activity</em>. </p> <p>This system hardly hurts the big banks. In the long run, it benefits them: they can afford to spend marginally more on <em>compliance</em>, as the paperwork-filing is called, while their smaller competitors can't. So the big banks eat the little ones, growing bigger. As an added bonus, they look appealingly meek and law-abiding: see how many reports we've filed? How much <em>suspicious activity</em> we've rooted out? Aren't we diligent in abiding by the will of the people, as expressed through their duly elected lawmakers?</p> <p>The suspicious activity reports aren't acted on, as mentioned earlier, either by bankers or regulators, but every few years the accumulated weight of wrongdoing breaks some invisible dam, and a big fine does come. It's long since been budgeted for. The headlines last a week, the damage to profits and bonuses a quarter, the televised excoriation by Congress a few hours. (Even the previously mentioned $1.3 billion Westpac paid in 2020, while it ended the CEO's tenure, didn't prevent the bank from turning a profit that same year.<sup><a href='#fn159' id='fnref159' epub:type='noteref'>159</a></sup>)</p> <p>This system benefits the politicians as well: they get to be seen grilling bankers from on high, 'getting tough' by writing still more regulations, acting as tribunes of the people. Since in the end they only make the richest bankers richer, they can count on donations during their career and 'speaking fees' (bribes in arrears) upon retirement.</p> <p>Most of all, however, this system benefits law enforcement: they can gorge on a wealth of sensitive financial data without needing to trouble themselves about the Fourth Amendment. Banks can't allow suspicious activity, after all; they have to file reports. And courts can't force cops to jump through hoops and obtain warrants for information the banks are already offering freely (<em>freely</em>, as required by statute).</p> <p>The result of all this 'regulation' is not a cleaner financial system; it is, in the words of Coin Center's Neeraj K. Agrawal, a 'warrantless surveillance regime.' And it's built, again in Agrawal's words, on a single key assumption: 'that people would always need intermediaries to transact.'<sup><a href='#fn160' id='fnref160' epub:type='noteref'>160</a></sup></p> <p>This is why bankers, politicians, law enforcement and their hangers-on (journalists in particular) want to pin crime, money laundering, tax evasion, terrorist financing and the rest on crypto. They want to incorporate it into this system, to introduce intermediaries into the equation or turn existing participants into intermediaries, so that they can lean on someone to spy on customers, donate to campaigns, look meek during hearings, pay speaking fees.</p> <p>They know – at least the sophisticated ones do – that the overwhelming majority of financial filth passes through the legacy financial system's plumbing.<sup><a href='#fn161' id='fnref161' epub:type='noteref'>161</a></sup> They know their system wouldn't prevent the same outcome in crypto. Stopping financial crime is not the point.</p> <p>The problem, from their perspective, is that a crypto transaction requires no intermediaries. Miners and validators might seem to fit this description, but because no one can dictate who can (or can't) play those roles, how they must behave, or what paperwork they have to file, miners are effectively abstracted away: between one user and another, there lies only a protocol. </p> <p>When a new block of transactions comes up for validation, someone, let's call him Bob, must of course do the actual validation. Bob could go rogue and try to cheat users out of their funds; the network will reject this attempt without the need for any human intervention; these defenses are built into the software. Bob could also attempt to police his fellow users according to some scheme extraneous to the protocol: enforcing U.S. sanctions against Iran, say, or refusing to process donations to a certain political campaign.</p> <p>This will work for a few seconds, until it's time to process a new batch of transactions, and a different validator who doesn't share Bob's scruples processes the ones he refused to. Bob has no way to impose his will on the network. Transactions which are valid according to the protocol – which incorporates no statutes, morals or KYC/AML requirements (you can read the code to be sure)<sup><a href='#fn162' id='fnref162' epub:type='noteref'>162</a></sup> – will go through without noticeable delay. There is no intermediary.</p> <p>Until relatively recently, the above assertions seemed theoretically sound, but remained untested. Nothing on the order of a military and economic superpower had tried to impose a specific, additional constraint on a crypto protocol, to test whether it could insert itself as a sort of shadow intermediary.</p> <p>Then in August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the division of the U.S. Treasury tasked with imposing economic sanctions on foreign baddies, added an ethereum defi application to its list of sanctioned entities. Tornado Cash is a privacy tool that takes deposits of ether, mixes them together with clever cryptography, and allows the depositor to withdraw to a new, fresh address. It breaks the link that ethereum's public ledger establishes between the various addresses a user might control. It lets privacy-conscious users buy an NFT or deploy a smart contract without the whole world knowing the rest of their on-chain transaction history. It also allows North Korean hackers to clean their stolen money.</p> <p>So in a first for the office, OFAC sanctioned a machine.<sup><a href='#fn163' id='fnref163' epub:type='noteref'>163</a></sup> Many applications on ethereum depend on a degree of human input. One or more human developers need to be involved for the application's value proposition to be fulfilled. Not Tornado Cash. The protocol continued to work despite one of its developers being thrown in jail (for months, without charges, in a Western democracy, while prosecutors seized his car and threatened to auction it off).<sup><a href='#fn164' id='fnref164' epub:type='noteref'>164</a></sup></p> <p>In principle, a person under American jurisdiction could face the same sort of penalty for facilitating a Tornado Cash transaction as they would for doing business with a Syrian war criminal. And yet it was never difficult to get a Tornado Cash transaction processed. A significant proportion of ethereum validators, wishing to avoid long stints in federal prison, complied with the sanctions and declined to validate any transaction touching the application.<sup><a href='#fn165' id='fnref165' epub:type='noteref'>165</a></sup> But hundreds of such transactions went through the day after the sanctions were imposed, just as they had the day before.</p> <p>Even bringing its most draconian punishments to bear on the issue, the U.S. can't regulate an individual ethereum application out of existence. Ethereum has no intermediaries, so there is no one for it to bring the hammer down on. Its friends in the Dutch courts can punish the software developer who created the machine, but once it's deployed, no one can stop the machine from running.</p> <p>This is only the most dramatic example of the state's attempts to turn crypto into a set of intermediaries. In 2021, as part of a bill funding infrastructure improvements, Congress updated the definition of a 'broker' for tax purposes to include miners, validators, and not a few hardware manufacturers and software developers. These actors – or some subset of them, the correct interpretation of the law remains unclear at the time of writing – will be required to file tax forms on behalf of their 'customers,' that is, pseudonymous participants in the network, who could be anyone living in any jurisdiction.<sup><a href='#fn166' id='fnref166' epub:type='noteref'>166</a></sup> </p> <p>Under crypto networks' current design, a miner or defi developer knows a user by their address, a pseudonymous string of numbers and letters, such as <code>0xe03c23519e18d64f144d2800e30e81b0065c48b5</code>. This address' on-chain activity and balances are public, but there's no way of knowing who the address belongs to, or what other addresses that person might control. There's certainly no way of obtaining the user's full legal name, street address and tax identification number in order to fill out a 1099.</p> <p>The protocols won't be updated to accommodate this new reporting requirement. Those who feel they must comply will stop participating, leaving non-Americans, those brave enough to defy the IRS, those ignorant of the law, and those who were already breaking it anyway.</p> <p>The state relies on intermediaries, not to prevent bad people from doing bad things, but to surveil and control the people under its jurisdiction. Because of crypto, these people no longer need intermediaries.</p> <p>So we'll have a War on Crypto – or rather, we already do: it started sometime in 2021. Like preceding wars on things that can't sign treaties – poverty, drugs, terror – it will cost a lot of money, erode a lot of rights, fill a lot of jail cells and provide fodder for a lot of speeches. I very much doubt it will kill crypto.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>We should hope that it doesn't. The right to transact is important. We have enjoyed it by default since money first arose. Without it, we're likely to suffer indignities, violations of basic liberties, perhaps atrocities. And even if we were to give up a right of such long standing – which we should emphatically not – the case must be made to us. We need to have a debate, an election, a fight, not an obscure slurry of bureaucratic rules that few notice, fewer remark on, and everyone suffers as a result of.</p> <p><em>But money laundering</em> is not sufficient justification.</p> <p>And if we wish to safeguard our right to transact, the one technology we have at our disposal is cryptocurrency. There is no other tool that enables people to transact at a distance without intermediaries. If it existed, I'd weigh it against crypto. Truth be told I might be prejudiced in its favor: it's been a long few years. The fact is no such third option exists.</p> <p>We can and should introduce 'the right to transact' into the everyday civic lexicon – make it as ubiquitous as 'free speech' and 'due process.' We can and should pass laws protecting it, found organizations to lobby and litigate in its favor, pass a constitutional amendment enshrining it. I support all of the above and more.</p> <p>But the margin between a constitutional democracy governed by the rule of law and the many less-pleasant alternatives can be as thin as one eventful afternoon. When the wise laws and just precedents are gone, when the elegant debating points get you thrown in a cage, our surest guarantee of liberty is censorship-resistant money, encoded in software that anyone can run without permission.</p> <h2>Closing thoughts</h2> <p><em>Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.</em></p> <p>Harry S. Truman</p> <p><br /></p> <p>I started working on this essay at some point in 2021. I had a title, more or less – I hadn't decided between the 'right' or 'freedom' to transact – and a few years of obsession with cryptocurrency under my belt, but it was hard to give the thesis any real shape.</p> <p>PayPal had been exercising arbitrary, quasi-moralist rule over its user base for years, but so what? One largish company behaving badly isn't a reason to revisit the social contract. 'CBDC' was an acronym wrapped around the vaguest proposition: what if the central bank issued its money, you know, digitally? Portraying it as an imminent threat to human liberty seemed unconvincing.</p> <p>But it was clear, as covid lockdowns stretched into a second year, that a new and bleak chapter in the history of authoritarian overreach was being written. Every sort of institution – media, academia, government, law enforcement, nonprofits, tech, pharma – closed ranks against dissent of any sort. So did many workplaces and families.</p> <p>The consensus was that there were two pandemics: the literal virus and the virus of heresy, necessitating a strict intellectual lockdown to stop the spread. Anyone who questioned the orthodoxy – however circumscribed their objections or sound their reasoning – was an antivaxer, a conspiracy theorist, a white supremacist. (An Arian, a Cathar, a Monophysite.) It was the duty of all right-thinking people – however close their relationship to the heathen – to deny them bread and water.</p> <p>I felt this moral spasm made the freedom to transact all the more important, and that – ironically, given the parabolic run crypto was on at the time – no one was talking about it.</p> <p>But I had so little to point to in the way of concrete violations of this freedom. I rambled for a dozen pages or so about what-ifs and the Principle of the Thing. I fought the urge to give up.</p> <p>As I write, I have a very different problem. Every day some corporate executive, bureaucrat or politician commits some further outrage against the right to transact. Every time I knock the last item off my to-write list – <em>just mention this one last thing and you can call it quits, just this one last thing</em> – a new one last thing appears.</p> <p> The shift began with the Canadian government's order to freeze its political opponents' assets without any hint of due process. Then it accelerated. I wish I could feel some vindication that my sense of foreboding in 2021 had some basis, but I don't. I feel anger, foreboding, and an inability to catch up.<br /> <br /> I want to apologize for the disjointed nature of much of this essay. It's a direct result of being overtaken by events – of continuously realizing I need to stuff some fresh Development into the text, and watching what little structure it had disintegrate. </p> <p>But mostly I want to thank you for reading this far. This topic has consumed me for the better part of two years, and it means everything to me that you care.</p> <p>We are on a dangerous path, and the more people who realize it and can talk about it coherently – a bar I'm not at all sure I've cleared – the better our chances of avoiding disaster.</p> <p>For millennia, we've been able to buy and sell among ourselves without worrying whether some earthly power would log our every transaction or somehow step in to stop us. This freedom wasn't a matter of enlightened principle or a statute inherited from dim antiquity; it was a practical reality. Even the most paranoid tyrants of the modern era didn't imagine they could somehow inject their diktats into the medium of exchange.</p> <p>Their successors plan to. The next crop of despots is harnessing currency itself to their yoke – or harnessing us to the yoke of their currency – and few of us realize it. We need to fight this agenda in legislatures, courts, board rooms, living rooms, restaurants and bars. We need laws to protect the right to transact, norms to provide it a buffer, memes to make it intelligible.</p> <p>And more importantly, we need to build, adopt and use the one set of technology currently capable of providing an exit from this nightmare: cryptocurrency.</p> <p>One life, it's worth an attempt.</p> <h2>About the author</h2> <p>My name is Zelinar XY, or ZXY for short.

Worse, the pattern is fractal: no amount of zooming in will show you where the bright dividing lines between factions lie. Ideologies, loyalties and identities are as likely to be tangled and incoherent within a single person's head, particularly over a few years, as they are within a larger community. Government, being in large part made up of 'the people,' reproduces this complexity. So do industry, media, civil society, the military, organized crime, big men, old families, unions and religious institutions, any one or combination of which could be more relevant to a given power struggle than the government per se.

They're not contracts: they don't define agreements between parties who sign onto them. There's no agreement, no parties, no signing. They're not 'smart' in the sense purveyors of consumer gadgetry use the term – which is too vague to really pin down, but might imply some sort of automation. Smart contracts can't take any action at all unless prompted by a user, who sends a transaction to that contract over the network. Left to their own devices, smart contracts do exactly nothing.</p> <p>Here's what a smart contract is: it's a software application, but instead of being installed on a laptop or served through a website, it lives on ethereum's global decentralized computer. It can do anything its programmer designs it to, with whatever inputs its users choose to give it. It can be buggy. It can be a scam. It can be benign and flawlessly designed. It can be simple or complex. Ethereum is a Turing-complete environment, so a smart contract can be coded do anything any other software can. The catch is that it can be extremely expensive to use compared to normal software, if you're not careful.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we're stuck with the term 'smart contract,' unhelpful though it is, because it was coined well before ethereum, or even bitcoin, was invented, and it's too deeply entrenched to change.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn86' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref86'>86.</a> International Monetary Fund.

In extreme cases, people can lose their land, job, right to reside in a country, or assets. But presenting as a solution an even stricter identity regime, to which the ability to use digital money would now be tied, is exactly backwards: the state is the one demanding proof of identity in the first place, through regulations it imposes on private actors, if not directly. It is not a disinterested party stepping in to rescue the paperless from the caprice of whoever's out there demanding people's papers. Almost anyone who asks for your papers does so at the behest of the government. Ordinary people seldom yearn for universal, inescapable identities – serial numbers they can never slough off.

In a permissioned system, this assumption doesn't hold, so there's no need for a cumbersome system of decentralized validation. If a misbehaving node can simply be kicked off the network, a 'distributed ledger' becomes a needlessly slow database.</p> <p>The DLT idea emerged during the 2016-2018 cryptocurrency hype cycle, when self-styled innovators in the banking sector wished to capture some of the attention, talent and investment that bitcoin and its ilk had attracted. Permissionless, decentralized bearer assets being anathema to regulated financial institutions, the bankers framed DLT as an improvement on the 'Wild West' of crypto: all the benefits, but now with KYC/AML.</p> <p>In fact, the benefits of crypto, as bitcoin's early adopters conceived them, consisted in the elimination of – or at least escape from – banks. The other benefits bankers at the time cited (speed, cost savings, efficiency) existed only in comparison to the teetering, decades-old mess that was banks' half-digitized back office architecture, if at all. Crypto was slow and expensive to use, because it was designed to work reliably in an anarchic environment of mutual hostility. (This remains basically true, though incremental improvements to transaction speed and cost have been made.)<br /> </p> <p>Bitcoin has no custodians or cops who can intervene in the system to freeze or confiscate assets. Banks are custodians empowered to do just that, often at the behest of the cops. In such an environment, the tech behind cryptocurrency has scant relevance. If the system is centralized, why build a distributed ledger? Better to choose a fast, reliable, centralized database.</p> <p>The DLT idea persists, however.

I could, for example, set up a 'three-of-five' multisig, which requires three addresses out of a pool of five to sign a transaction before it can be executed. One address might be tied to a 'hot' wallet on my laptop. Another might be tied to a 'cold' hardware wallet I keep in a safe deposit box. My brother might hold onto a third. And so on. Now the attacker needs to convince several people to give up the goods, and/or gain control of several devices in disparate places. None of this makes theft impossible, but it's worth noting the progress that's been made on this front.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn151' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref151'>151.</a> Readers familiar with the contention that 'code is law' might be wondering if I'm flirting with that interpretation of hacks and their moral implications.

The organization churns out a steady stream of stories alleging tax evasion and money laundering by states, multinational corporations, banks, terrorists and organized criminals. The plodding cadence of revelations – Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Pandora Papers, FinCEN Files, Luanda Leaks, Mauritius Leaks, West Africa Leaks – suggests that the system of financial surveillance built up in recent decades, along with the 'crackdowns' announced by embarrassed governments following each new revelation, are ineffective.<br /> </p> <p>Also notable is how little crypto is mentioned in these leaks (<a href='https://www.icij.org/?s=crypto'>https://www.icij.org/?s=crypto</a>). The vast majority of articles using the term are quoting or paraphrasing embarrassed government officials, who argue that if they could only have more funds and power to surveil dark corners of the financial system – especially cryptocurrency – all this malfeasance would end. See, for example, the head of FinCEN lamenting the 'budget situation' after the agency was found to be doing nothing to stop money laundering, despite its vast, existing surveillance powers (Woodman). The investigation into FinCEN's failure doesn't mention crypto once. FinCEN's chief mentions it repeatedly (Leopold et al.).</p> <p>In a couple of articles, the ICIJ mentions misconduct by centralized crypto exchanges or outright scammers. I've shared my thoughts on centralized exchanges above.</p> <p>I've only found one specific instance of cryptocurrency being used as a vehicle for money laundering in ICIJ's corpus: Alexander Vinnik, the operator of a Russian centralized crypto exchange, used his business as a vehicle for money laundering (Sadek et al.). Frankly, I would have expected more examples. I suppose the legacy financial system is simply too reliable and effective a vehicle for financial crimes for crypto to compete with it.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn162' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref162'>162.</a> bitcoin; go-ethereum.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn163' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref163'>163.</a> U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn164' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref164'>164.</a> Schickler; Khatri.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn165' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref165'>165.</a> Nijkerk.</p> </aside> <aside id='fn166' epub:type='footnote'> <p><a epub:type='noteref' href='#fnref166'>166.</a> Goldberg et al.</p> </aside> </body> </html>
