or, more likely, an automated system, registers some Suspicious Activity. It expels the person responsible without providing any form of recourse or due process: Your account has been flagged for unusual activity. Please contact our support team to resolve this issue. The support team is an AI chat bot that might as well be a stone wall, and there's no way to speak to a human being.\n\n\nWelcome to the black market.\n\n\nThe offenses for which a person might be removed from the payments infrastructure are unlikely to have been clearly enumerated by a democratically elected legislature. More likely they'll be written by employees of a federal agency, or the Federal Reserve, or a private-sector firm to which CBDC development has been contracted out. These rules almost certainly won't be limited in scope or subject to more than symbolic oversight. Rather, they're likely to include the sort of any other unacceptable conduct, as solely determined by us language familiar to the dozen or so people who have actually read a terms of service agreement all the way through.\nEnds and means\nIn some ways the preceding hypothetical is a bit extreme: most likely, relatively few individuals would be totally removed from a CBDC economy. Remove too many people entirely, and the black market will outstrip the approved one.\n\n\nRather than focus too much on the unfortunate few who would be entirely excommunicated, let's consider the far greater numbers who would be subject to subtler infringements of their freedom.\n\n\nHaving lacked the option to instantaneously fine-tune entire populations' access to money, it's hard to say exactly what policymakers would choose to do with this ability. There are no straightforward precedents. Still, it's worth speculating. Sooner or later we'll arrive at a juncture where politicians and bureaucrats do enjoy these capabilities, in some countries if not most, so we should devote some thought to what they might do with them.\n\n\nPresumably, at least in the beginning, they would pursue benign-sounding goals. We can imagine a few possibilities: encouraging healthy, sustainable eating; discouraging drug and alcohol abuse; boosting favored industries; giving historically marginalized groups a leg up; and keeping inflation and unemployment in check.\n\n\nYou may find that your spending on fresh produce is subsidized with little discounts to encourage a healthy diet. Same, perhaps, for plant-based meat substitutes. You might find, by contrast, that the five pounds of steak you wanted to buy for a birthday barbecue trigger a penalty, or even rejection: three pounds of red meat is the most you can purchase in a week. Perhaps your third trip to the bar or casino this week similarly fails. Or maybe your phone's accelerometer, GPS and other sensors come to the conclusion that you've been indulging in cocaine again, and it's time to throttle your spending for 36 hours so you can rethink your choices.\n\n\nPerhaps, in line with the Fed's attempts to lower unemployment and raise consistently below-target inflation (those were the days), a negative interest rate has been put in place, with the result that your deposits automatically fall by 0.5% per year.\n\n\nPerhaps, in order to reduce wealth inequality or discourage premature retirement, each dollar saved comes with a 20-year expiration date. \n\n\nOr perhaps a recent "police-involved shooting" has led to protests in your part of town. Wallets in the area might be frozen until the crowds disperse – or even, to teach the querulous districts a lesson, a bit longer.\n\n\nIt's easy to imagine that no one will be entirely free to spend their money on legal goods and services as they please. All money will to some degree resemble food stamps: not a uniform, neutral and universal means of exchange, but a form of coupon subject to complex, changing and humiliating rules. Your purchasing power will be a function of the government's opinion of your decision-making abilities.\n\n\nUnlike food stamps, though, the restrictions need not apply to all recipients in the same way. Favored people will obtain favored objects more easily. Disfavored people will need to justify their choices, and disfavored objects of desire will become harder to obtain. Nothing in principle would stop such restrictions from taking the minutest individual circumstances into account: limits to your freedom to transact could be targeted with the precision of social media ads.\n\n\nThis is of course far too much power for anyone to have over the medium of exchange. The state cannot be allowed to intrude into every economic event, however minute, and not just as a spectator, but as the final arbiter of that transaction's acceptability.\n\n\nBefore moving on, I should stress that the above – even if it sounds awful – is a relatively optimistic scenario. It's a vision of the sort of bumbling, manageably corrupt, blinkered, corporatized, residually competent state typical of Western democracies circa 2023.\n\n\nBut there's no guarantee this situation persists even in the medium term. When a government veers sharply towards totalitarianism of whatever sort – communist, fascist, theocratic or in thrall to some fresh horror – it will enjoy the same fearsome control over payment systems as its on-the-whole democratic predecessor.\n\n\nThe ability to interfere with people's freedom to transact, once obtained, will outlast any particular government or form of government. Even if liberal democracy writ large enjoys centuries of continued vigor, a few countries will fall into totalitarianism along the way. Anyone living in a constitutional democracy should hesitate to build a CBDC or any similar system – certainly for their own sakes, but also for their children's.\n\n\nAnd in any case, such a level of centralized control in itself can't help but alter the basic character of the state. The capabilities of centralized programmable currencies will change constitutional democracy in significant and unpredictable ways, assuming they don't simply destroy it.\nWorse-case scenarios \nLet's imagine this system in the hands of a more straightforwardly ruthless regime. First, we should acknowledge that the system can be combined with hyper-accurate personal data of any sort: location data, browsing history, social media interactions, calls, texts, medical records, "smart home" audio recordings, footage from security cameras (equipped with facial recognition), genetic data. All of this data can then be synthesized, organized and interpreted with the aid of artificial intelligence.\n\n\nAny government will eventually attempt to bring these methods of surveillance and analysis together into a more or less coherent apparatus. (Success is of course not guaranteed.) But the more straightforwardly power-hungry the state, the more quickly it will do so, and the less compunction it will have about, say, barring you from renting in a certain neighborhood due to the contents of your genome.\n\n\nDictators have long seized and doled out assets to win support or punish dissent. Equipped with full visibility into and control over transactions, they'll be able to do so with ease and precision. Disfavored groups – be they long-oppressed or former oppressors – could find themselves, if not simply robbed, then fleeced by inflated prices, or barred from obtaining scarce or desirable goods. The malicious logic of the Jim Crow-era shop owner who quotes one price for a white customer and another, higher one for a black customer could be built into the means of exchange itself.\n\n\nThose marginalized by the state could be hemmed into ghettos by geographically delineated permissions to shop, rent, work, or get transportation. Even merchants and landlords who opposed such controls couldn't easily protest them: the transactions would simply fail. Nor does the control of movement need to be purely spatial: leaders will be able to impose targeted lockdowns and curfews using the same means (recall the protesting depositors' surprise covid diagnoses in Henan).\n\n\nAnd these restrictions could be arbitrarily fine-tuned. Using location data, the screws could be tightened on anyone who's frequented a particular house of worship – or failed to. The criteria for punishment could be anything: having purchased a certain book, downloaded a certain file, visited a certain clinic, immigrated from a certain country, attempted to emigrate to another one, purchased from a certain business – or better yet, failed to. Or it could be a matter of having spoken a bit too freely in the presence of a smartphone microphone.\n\n\nI'm hardly the first one to raise these concerns. Maya Zehavi, an Israeli founder and investor in the cryptocurrency industry, has written: "The number one reason I'm against CBDC in the surveillance mode BIS is promoting - how my extended family managed to hide away money & gold to survive the ww2 in relative safety. The rising fascism across the world alongside brewing antisemitism means we need to support a web […] For the worst case scenario."[15]\n\n\nIn order to avoid becoming a tool of repression, money needs to remain neutral and portable. Enforcing the law is all well and good. But what if it's against the law to be Jewish, Tutsi, Rohingya, Uyghur? Have modern states demonstrated the wisdom and humanity we'd expect of institutions aspiring to build CBDCs? \n\n\nIt's also important to stress that official neglect can be as harmful as official malice. Barring unprecedented feats of conscientiousness and efficiency on the part of the state, there will be many whose remoteness, poverty, lack of education, or mental or physical impairment will prevent them from gaining access to a CBDC in the first place. The state will have no particular quarrel with them – only a measure of contempt, when and if it remembers them. The result will be the same.\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, central bankers almost always cite "financial inclusion" (access to a bank account and a means of payment) as a reason to adopt CBDCs.[16] It's true enough in principle that central banks could offer CBDC access to people who can't open accounts at private-sector banks.\n\n\nBut in what world is making the use of currency – in any form – contingent on clearing bureaucratic hurdles like identity verification an improvement on the status quo? As I'll discuss later on, central banks also tout the ability to surveil CBDC usage and root out money laundering and illicit activity as an advantage. To do so, by their own admission, they'd need to tie CBDC accounts to verified, government-issued IDs – exactly what many of today's financially excluded lack.\nMonopoly money\nNor will those excluded from the CBDC system, intentionally or not, be able to fall back on legacy forms of payment like cash – at least not legally. For the scheme to even plausibly accomplish policy goals, governments will need to ban physical cash.[17]\n\n\nSubsidies, taxes, interest rates, stimulus payments, fines, geographic restrictions, curfews, caps on holdings, expiration dates, surveillance – if alternatives to central bank digital money are allowed to persist, all of these tools lose at least some of their efficacy. Witness European central bankers' anxiety about (metaphorical, mostly) mattresses stuffed with cash, which made passing negative interest rates through to ordinary savers more or less impossible. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Andy Haldane floated a CBDC as a solution to this dilemma in a speech in 2015.[18]\n\n\nOf course, black market means of exchange will emerge. Loopholes and workarounds will be found within the system. Their exact forms will depend on the system's idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities, but they'll certainly make use of combinations of flawed software, gaps in surveillance, and human laziness and corruption.\n\n\nThere will also be parallel systems: physical or digital tokens more or less emulating cash will almost certainly circulate, but using them will invite punishment. For an idea of how little sense of humor the state is likely to have regarding alternate payment systems, see its reaction to tax evasion.\nTax evasion, money laundering and crime\nSpeaking of which, I should address a whole range of criticisms of my position. Collected under one heading, we might say: censorship-resistant, permissionless – in a word "free" – transactions are, in fact, bad.\n\n\nPeople who argue the above might cite any combination of the following ills, all of which the freedom to transact does or at least could in principle facilitate: tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, smuggling, bribery, gambling, prostitution, trade in weapons, predatory lending, extortion, and terrorist financing. Apologies if I've forgotten anything: human creativity, in financial wrongdoing as in all things, is boundless.\n\n\nSmall-scale tax evasion would certainly become more difficult under a CBDC regime. Cash transactions make underreporting not just easy but, I've heard, tempting. Governments have long managed to collect taxes without the aid of a financial panopticon, though given the tenacity of tax evasion, a certain amount of frustration is understandable.\n\n\nModern states, more often than not, run grisly deficits, since they fail to tax at a rate anywhere near commensurate with their expenditures. (To do so would, at least in America, probably be impossible.) The incentive to build a system of total financial surveillance and control is clear, but I would argue that we simply can't consider tax evasion sufficient justification for the sort of regime that's being contemplated.\n\n\nAfter all, the ability to transact freely is nothing new: it's been the default for almost the entire time modern tax regimes have existed. Revenue collection has been imperfect as a result, but even so states have managed – at times – to keep debt within sustainable limits. When fiscal crises have occurred, the culprit has been war, unnecessary infrastructure projects, corruption, outright theft by the regime, or gambling by bankers far more often than it's been an especially tax-averse populace. Even where the tax take is abysmally low, the blame often lies with leaders who purchase political backing through low taxes and lax collection.\n\n\nEnding tax evasion, an unobjectionable goal in the abstract, would not prevent profligate states from spending their way into crisis. Nor would it merit the sacrifices in terms of freedom and human dignity the solution would demand. In any case, the most sophisticated and prolific tax avoiders would pursue technically legal means, the same as they do now. People who use cash to evade taxes hide thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in income; people who use offshore tax havens hide millions or tens of millions.\n\n\nMoney laundering is a similar story: in a perfect world, it would be unknown. A perfectly surveilled remote-control currency could conceivably put a stop to criminals' washing their proceeds through cash businesses, since cash wouldn't exist. But the stereotypical picture of money laundering through nail salons, strip clubs, pizza shops, or the classic laundromats – while I have no doubt it occurs – distorts the picture terribly.\n\n\nIndustrial-scale money laundering is performed not by these small, more or less seedy, cash-based businesses, but by huge multinational banks. These institutions are already subject to reams of regulation that require reporting and disclosure of "suspicious" activity. They are as fully deputized to the financial surveillance apparatus as any sector could be, and yet the most cursory glance at their record in combating money laundering yields, well:\n\n• "Wachovia pays $160 million to settle drug money probe" (2010)[19]\n\n\n• "HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money-Laundering Charges" (2012)[20]\n\n\n• "Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme" (2019)[21]\n\n\n• "How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled" (2019)[22]\n\n\n• "Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation" (2020)[23]\n\n\n• "Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal" (2020)[24]\n\n\n• "FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning" (2020)[25]\n\n\n• "Bank of America insider charged with money laundering for BEC scams" (2021)[26]\n\n\n• "US families sue Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, accuse them of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan" (2021)[27]\n\n\n• "Credit Suisse found guilty in cocaine cash laundering case" (2022)[28]\n\n\nIt could be argued that these institutions, while subject to extensive and expensive post-9/11 know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, are simply ignoring them, and that imposing surveillance and control at the level of the individual transaction could force compliance.\n\n\nAs it turns out, though, the failure isn't the banks' alone. For the most part, they conduct the surveillance required by the American government, filing millions of "suspicious activity reports" (SARs) with FinCEN, the division of the Treasury Department tasked with combating money laundering, every year. Each SAR filing sets in motion an intricate protocol, as BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported in 2020, whereby the government ignores the reports and … the end.[29]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey by the Bank Policy Institute, less than 4% of SARs "warranted follow-up inquiries from law enforcement."[30]\n\n\nThis hollow ritual allows the banks to "comply" with regulations by filing the proper forms and, when American regulators say nothing, continue to launder blood money. It allows American bureaucrats and politicians to claim to be fighting terrorists, drug dealers and mobsters. Occasionally, perhaps because a bank has failed to file the proper forms, the bureaucrats impose the sort of fine that banks can easily view as a cost of doing business. These "enforcement actions" allow the bureaucracy to publish a press release and the politicians to rail against banks, whose campaign contributions they, for the most part, continue to accept.\nWhat the ritual does not accomplish is stopping Mexican or Colombian drug cartels, or kleptocrats in Soviet successor states, or jihadist terrorists, or the operators of Ponzi schemes from cleaning their money. The most commonly cited estimate for the effectiveness of global anti-money laundering controls is in the range of 0.1-0.2% – one or two dollars in every thousand.[31] (This statistic also implies that other jurisdictions are no more effective than the U.S. in this regard.)\n\n\nWhat KYC/AML policies do accomplish is surveillance. FinCEN's 2020 report to Congress, in which it justifies its funding, repeatedly boasts that it has generated millions of reports of cash transactions, which are "used to identify enforcement and investigative leads as well as strategic trends and patterns."[32] Plainly, however, money laundering continues apace. The purpose of KYC/AML laws as they exist today is to enhance government surveillance of the financial system.\n\n\nSo it's no surprise that money laundering is being used to justify the creation of a system enabling total visibility into the entire field of economic activity: it's an old, successful playbook.\n\n\nProponents of CBDCs frequently claim that their introduction (and cash's elimination) would solve some of the financial system's most persistent and acute problems. In a paper cited by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution claim that "the widespread use of CBDC and the obsolescence of paper currency would be helpful in discouraging tax evasion, money laundering, and other illegal activities."[33]\n\n\nThe same claim is repeated in almost every favorable discussion of CBDCs, and it is almost certainly false. Particularly in the case of money laundering, policymakers have invoked the modern world's worst boogeymen to justify increasingly invasive scrutiny into individuals' finances. The system fails abjectly at accomplishing its stated goals,[34] but succeeds in gaining visibility into people's transactions – visibility that would be denied under normal constitutional procedures, whereby authorities who want to spy on people need to obtain warrants.\n\n\nIn an authoritarian tactic almost too cliché for parody, the state is demanding that we surrender basic freedoms in order to escape suspicion that we're drug dealers or terrorists.\nThe DMV\nSimilar logic has become so pervasive in the last couple of decades, it can be difficult to realize how strange and pernicious it really is.\n\n\nSo imagine the same way of thinking applied to driving: when you go to the DMV to renew your license, you're handed a tracking device you must attach to your car. Your movements – all of them – are recorded in a DMV database. Any time you drive more than 10 miles, the data from the journey is automatically reported to local, state and federal law enforcement (no need for them to request it, much less obtain a warrant).\n\n\nIf you travel more than 50 miles, or travel to a place you haven't been before, or make any stops in an area labeled "suspicious" – there are many such areas, they change frequently, and you're responsible for knowing where they are – you need to file a Travel Justification Report and submit it to the DMV by fax. Repeated failure to do so could result in fines, suspension of your license, even jail time.\n\n\nIt's universally recognized that everyone who drives violates the rules daily. It's wildly impractical to comply with them all, and perhaps, given their complexity and overlap, actually impossible. As a result, you or anyone else could be punished at any time. You have little prospect of defending yourself: of course you've broken the rules, everyone has. The best way to protect yourself is to have friends at the DMV and police precinct.\n\n\nWhy are you being subjected to this bureaucratic lunacy? Because organized crime syndicates use roads to transport drugs. Because domestic extremists use roads to transport weapons and carry out terror attacks. Because human traffickers use roads to transport minors for sexual exploitation. What are you suggesting – that none of that matters?\nThe inevitable hack\nI've struggled to find the appropriate place to weave this next point into the argument, so I've left it as an inelegant close to this chapter. Then again, perhaps it makes sense as a jarring coda: in a way, that's what a hack is.\nEven if every worry I've expressed so far about CBDCs is misplaced, one bad outcome is all but inevitable: a substantial amount of the sensitive, valuable data collected through this new form of money will leak. The government will do its best to avoid a breach, and sooner or later it will fail.\n\n\nHackers will steal some or all of the transaction data, giving them potent leverage over people in positions of power, as well as countless ordinary people.\n\n\nLikely they'll be state-sponsored (hacking a government is generally not feasible for amateurs). There's precedent: beginning in 2014, Chinese government hackers obtained access to millions of personnel records held by the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management. The data was about as sensitive and valuable as any the state collects: it related to background checks conducted before granting security clearances to federal employees.[35] Such a haul is perfectly suited to facilitating the blackmail of U.S. officials by its most powerful adversary's intelligence agents, and still the government could not protect that information.\n\n\nStates should not be able to collect every detail of every payment conducted using their currency – because it's invasive, dangerous and unjust, but also because they can't be trusted to keep the data safe.\n\n\nNor is a spectacular attack by a rival superpower always necessary to create a breach. In 2018, the Tribune reported that access to Aadhaar, India's universal biometric identification scheme, was on sale to anyone who could pay. The paper's reporters were able to purchase not just the personal details of an individual or some chunk of individuals, but permission to search the entire database, containing highly sensitive information on over a billion people. The price was less than $10.[36]\nThe
