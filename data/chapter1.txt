Centralized control over the ability to buy and sell was impossible, as was centralized surveillance of individual transactions.\n\n\nThis freedom was a good thing, and now, as a result of rapidly evolving technology, it's disappearing.\n\n\nThe Canadian government has invoked emergency powers to freeze protesters' bank accounts without due process. PayPal has declared its intention to monitor users' speech and fine them for expressing views the company considers objectionable. \n\n\nAcross the industrialized world, central banks are planning to replace national currencies with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These will enable states to track and, if they wish, block or reverse any monetary transaction, no matter how trivial.\n\n\nWe can't accept this outcome. The freedom to transact needs to be seen as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. To do otherwise risks forfeiting protections we once took for granted against potentially horrific abuse: the ability to earn money and spend it on daily necessities without seeking the approval of powerful, unaccountable institutions.\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\nABI\n	Application Binary Interface\n	AI\n	Artificial Intelligence\n	Bacen\n	Central Bank of Brazil\n	BIS\n	Bank for International Settlements\n	BOE\n	Bank of England\n	CBDC\n	Central Bank Digital Currency\n	CCP\n	Chinese Communist Party\n	CISA\n	Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency\n	DHS\n	Department of Homeland Security\n	DLT\n	Distributed Ledger Technology\n	DMV\n	Department of Motor Vehicles\n	ECB\n	European Central Bank\n	ESG\n	Environmental, Social, Governance\n	EVM\n	Ethereum Virtual Machine\n	FBI\n	Federal Bureau of Investigation\n	Fed\n	Federal Reserve\n	IMF\n	International Monetary Fund\n	IoT\n	Internet of Things\n	IRS\n	Internal Revenue Service\n	KYC/AML\n	Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering\n	NSA\n	National Security Agency\n	OSG\n	Office of the Surgeon General\n	SAR\n	Suspicious Activity Report\n	UBI\n	Universal Basic Income\n	WEF\n	World Economic Forum\n	________________\nDefinitions\n\n\nThis essay will make frequent use of a few terms that might not be familiar. They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.\nCensorship resistance\nCensorship resistance refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.\n\n\nNo messaging app, however, is fully censorship-proof. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: censorship-resistant.\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.\n\n\nCensorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as non-confiscatable.\n\n\nAn example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.\n\n\nI should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.\n\n\nBitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like\n\nbc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj\n\n– and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.)\nPermissionlessness\nPermissionlessness refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're permissioned): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.\n\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are centralized. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.\n\n\nBitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.\n\n\nDecentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.\n________________\n\n\nInitial thoughts\n\n\nImagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.\n\n\nSuzuha\n\n\n\n\nA right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them rights in the first place.\n\n\nWe say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.\n\n\nBy the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.\n\n\nCertainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.\n\n\nAnd granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.\n\n\nSo why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.\n\n\nIf people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.\n\n\nThe other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.\n\n\nSuch permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.\n\n\nBut shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.[1] But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.\n\n\nTake speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.\n\n\nIn recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.\n\n\nOn the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.\n\n\nAfter the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.[2] From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.\n\n\nToday powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.[3] Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.\n\n\nOrdinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.\nMeanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'[4]) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.\n\n\nComplex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.\n\n\nPhil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:\n\n\n'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'[5]\n\n\nToday, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.\n\n\nToday we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.\n\n\nTechnological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.\n\n\nA state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.\n\n\nWe need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.\n\n\nWithin recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.[6])\n\n\nCredit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.\n\n\nNo one used payment apps. No one used any apps.\n\n\nThe beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.\n\n\nBy and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.\n\n\nSeveral factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.\nBut I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.\n\n\nToday, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.\n\n\nIn any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.\n\n\nGiven past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,[7] but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.\n\n\nThe topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.\n\n\nTo the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.\n\n\nThe generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.\n\n\nOrwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.\n\n\nTo revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological cont
