They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.\nCensorship resistance\nCensorship resistance refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.\n\n\nNo messaging app, however, is fully censorship-proof. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: censorship-resistant.\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.\n\n\nCensorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as non-confiscatable.\n\n\nAn example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.\n\n\nI should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.\n\n\nBitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like\n\nbc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj\n\n– and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.)\nPermissionlessness\nPermissionlessness refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're permissioned): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.\n\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are centralized. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.\n\n\nBitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.\n\n\nDecentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.\n________________\n\n\nInitial thoughts\n\n\nImagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.\n\n\nSuzuha\n\n\n\n\nA right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them rights in the first place.\n\n\nWe say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.\n\n\nBy the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.\n\n\nCertainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.\n\n\nAnd granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.\n\n\nSo why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.\n\n\nIf people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.\n\n\nThe other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.\n\n\nSuch permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.\n\n\nBut shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.[1] But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.\n\n\nTake speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.\n\n\nIn recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.\n\n\nOn the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.\n\n\nAfter the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.[2] From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.\n\n\nToday powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.[3] Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.\n\n\nOrdinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.\nMeanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'[4]) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.\n\n\nComplex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.\n\n\nPhil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:\n\n\n'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'[5]\n\n\nToday, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.\n\n\nToday we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.\n\n\nTechnological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.\n\n\nA state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.\n\n\nWe need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.\n\n\nWithin recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.[6])\n\n\nCredit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.\n\n\nNo one used payment apps. No one used any apps.\n\n\nThe beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.\n\n\nBy and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.\n\n\nSeveral factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.\nBut I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.\n\n\nToday, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.\n\n\nIn any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.\n\n\nGiven past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,[7] but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.\n\n\nThe topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.\n\n\nTo the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.\n\n\nThe generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.\n\n\nOrwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.\n\n\nTo revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological cont";

Hence the circumscribed term: censorship-resistant.\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.\n\n\nCensorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as non-confiscatable.\n\n\nAn example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.\n\n\nI should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.\n\n\nBitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like\n\nbc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj\n\n– and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.)\nPermissionlessness\nPermissionlessness refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're permissioned): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.\n\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are centralized. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.\n\n\nBitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.\n\n\nDecentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.\n________________\n\n\nInitial thoughts\n\n\nImagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.\n\n\nSuzuha\n\n\n\n\nA right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them rights in the first place.\n\n\nWe say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.\n\n\nBy the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.\n\n\nCertainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.\n\n\nAnd granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.\n\n\nSo why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.\n\n\nIf people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.\n\n\nThe other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.\n\n\nSuch permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.\n\n\nBut shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.[1] But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.\n\n\nTake speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.\n\n\nIn recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.\n\n\nOn the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.\n\n\nAfter the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.[2] From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.\n\n\nToday powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.[3] Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.\n\n\nOrdinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.\nMeanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'[4]) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.\n\n\nComplex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.\n\n\nPhil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:\n\n\n'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'[5]\n\n\nToday, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.\n\n\nToday we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.\n\n\nTechnological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.\n\n\nA state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.\n\n\nWe need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.\n\n\nWithin recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.[6])\n\n\nCredit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.\n\n\nNo one used payment apps. No one used any apps.\n\n\nThe beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.\n\n\nBy and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.\n\n\nSeveral factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.\nBut I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.\n\n\nToday, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.\n\n\nIn any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.\n\n\nGiven past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,[7] but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.\n\n\nThe topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.\n\n\nTo the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.\n\n\nThe generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.\n\n\nOrwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.\n\n\nTo revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological cont";
        string memory chapter2 = unicode"agion. According to the Annals of Lorsch, the emperor requested a copy of a history of the papacy from Pope Adrian I in 774. The book, which to be clear, had already been written, took a year to be hand-copied and transported over the Alps.\n\n\nThat was the velocity at which the two most powerful men in western Europe, the heirs of Peter the apostle and Caesar Augustus, could transmit information. Both would have been flummoxed by our anxiety over the instantaneous, global spread of heresy – sorry, misinformation – via light pulsing through massive cables at the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nTwelve centuries later, people's grasp of current and emerging technological capabilities is so unevenly distributed that we walk the earth simultaneously with Charlemagnes, Morses, Daguerres, Bells, Diffies and Berners-Lees.[8] Some of us, including the most powerful among us, don't consider how control of digital payment rails could pose a threat to anyone; others are launching us into a future so new and strange that vanishingly few people understand the risks and opportunities. Likely they themselves don't understand.\n\n\nWe won't have centuries to figure out the implications of credit cards – to say nothing of fully programmable money under centralized bureaucratic control in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\nCBDCs are one of the main concerns of this essay, and I'll go into borderline-excessive detail about them later on, but briefly: they are digital currency issued directly by central banks. Take Europe as an example. The European Central Bank issues the euro, and for the most part, euros are already digital; physical coins and bills make up a fraction of the total value of the currency. But the 'digital euro,' or whatever it ends up being called, will mark a sharp departure from how the euro works today.\n\n\nAs a CBDC, it will incorporate a complete record of every transaction in which it's used. This record will be available to bureaucrats and, by extension, politicians and law enforcement. Today, your bank knows when you spend euros deposited with them, or receive them to your account. But the central bank and the rest of the EU government don't know. They likely have some idea – perhaps more than you think – but their picture is necessarily incomplete.\n\n\nWith a CBDC, the state will receive a complete, real-time stream of all transaction data. Following the elimination of cash – a goal closely associated with the introduction of CBDCs – there will be no legal way to transact outside of this government panopticon.\n\n\nThe state will also be able to control CBDC transactions: freeze your account, confiscate your funds, prevent you from sending money to or receiving it from certain parties – whoever the state deems unfit. The rules governing how money works could in principle be arbitrarily complex and liable to change at any time.\n\n\nBanks can act this way today, and sometimes they do – often enough, when they do, it's at the behest of the state. But with a CBDC, the government will be able to intervene directly – no need to go through private-sector intermediaries who might make a fuss. Arbitrary limitations on the freedom to transact and summary seizures of funds might of course be illegal, but the question could quickly become academic. When violating the law at scale becomes so easy, the government might be hard to convince to do otherwise, especially when it can instantly revoke its critics' ability to buy food.\n\n\nFor the moment, CBDCs are more idea than reality. But world leaders are openly discussing their development and introduction. China is already testing a prototype at scale. The Bahamas has deployed one nationwide, the only country to do so – although almost no one uses it. In Europe and the U.S., bureaucratic and legislative wheels are turning. Journalists are being primed.\n\n\nThe same Turing completeness that lets you build a website that can look like anything and do anything with any data you give it, will determine the degree to which currency can be configured, manipulated and controlled. Drain the account of a single dissident; confiscate $200 from every resident of Los Angeles; give $50 to anyone who voted a certain way – hell, anyone born in July. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nOf course nothing is (entirely) new under the sun. Authorities have been seizing and doling out assets for millennia: the story of the Knights Templar comes to mind as a dramatic and well-known pre-modern example of punitive confiscation. But if Philip IV of France could seize the bodies and assets of 100-something individuals, he could never have dreamed of issuing an order that would render all the coinage in an entire district worthless instantly.\n\n\nThat's the sort of fearsome miracle central banks might be able to carry out in a few years: update a database row, tweak a configuration, perhaps for the really tough cases, write a few lines of code, et voilà.\n\n\nAs Matt Odell, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, has written, the preferred interface for this kind of thing is likely to be an AI chat bot, which 'seems ideal for weaponizing massive surveillance databases way more efficiently than current search tools.' (He provides an example input: 'close the bank accounts of anyone who went to the anti government protest in Paris last week.')[9]\n\n\nBy combining streams of near-perfect surveillance, the state will be able to view an individual's physical movements, reading material, expressions of opinion, social interactions and monetary transactions as a unified whole. They will have the ability to instantaneously throttle or halt the economic activity of individual dissidents and entire social groups.\n\n\nIn the U.S., this outcome still lies somewhere over the horizon – how far is anyone's guess – and may even be avoided to some appreciable degree. In China, this reality has already begun to take shape.\n\n\nBeginning in April 2022, banks in the central Chinese province of Henan suspended cash withdrawals, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without access to their savings. The following month, hundreds of protesters traveled to Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, to demand the return of their money. When they planned to repeat the protest that June, however, many found themselves unable to leave their homes. The government had falsely diagnosed them with covid, flipping the health codes on the would-be protesters' phones to red. Under the draconian lockdown regime in place in China at that time, this was the equivalent of placing them under house arrest.[10]\n\n\nThe mechanism for social control in this case wasn't a CBDC – though China has been actively testing one in a growing number of provinces since 2020 – but it's easy enough to see the template behind these actions: centralized institutions (according to protesters, the banks are connected to political power brokers) seize people's assets, then prevent their victims from causing trouble by restricting their movements.\n\n\nBoth steps could be accomplished more efficiently using a CBDC: you can go protest in Zhengzhou, no problem, as long as you don't need to pay for transportation or fuel or food.\n\n\nFortunately, even as new technologies are enabling sinister authoritarianism, they are providing a means of escape. A parallel financial system built on cryptocurrency protocols has begun to take shape. This system has defied censorship or control by even the most determined and powerful global actors, and it's only becoming stronger and more resilient. (Its relationship to surveillance is complex, simplifying it at times, frustrating at others, but it effectively thwarts attempts at censorship.)\n\n\nProponents of the emerging crypto financial system often stress the minimization of trust: you don't control your crypto assets when a custodian has promised to hold them for you, or the courts have vowed to protect them, or the architects of the system have assured you its source code is safe and benign. You control your crypto assets when, and only when, you're the only one in control of the cryptographic keys, and the software encoding the system is open for you and all the world to scrutinize, tinker with and attack.\n\n\nThis is all perfectly true. And it goes some way towards accomplishing a laudable goal: obviating the whole discussion of 'rights,' at least as far as money is concerned. Bankers, payment processors, politicians and bureaucrats will respect the sanctity of your rights, right up until the moment they don't. Ethereum, bitcoin and their ilk are machines. You can see the code they run on, and those are the rules. They are indifferent to moral panics, social engineering, dot plots and managerial maneuvering.\n\n\nThis description does not, of course, apply equally well to all cryptocurrencies, some of which are very much centralized. At the time of writing, though, protocols such as bitcoin and ethereum are credibly decentralized, neutral and censorship-resistant. Nor am I aware of a technology outside of cryptocurrency that accomplishes anything comparable.\n\n\nIf the technology exists to escape the slide into financial tyranny, then why write a polemic about the right to transact? Will invoking a slogan protect our freedoms better than building decentralized, censorship-resistant systems? Wouldn't my time be better spent implementing the latest research into, say, zero-knowledge proofs – or the nearest thing my skill set allows?\n\n\nDon't cypherpunks write code?[11]\n\n\nMy answer is that our technological arsenal is critical, but not enough on its own. We need social consensus on what the technology means and what ends it serves. Do elliptic curves care about our ideologies? Of course not. The shapes rotate on, elegant, indifferent, unstoppable. E pur si muove. But without an ideological, moral, political – in short, a memetic – component, we can't make the case for adopting these technologies at scale. We can't develop arguments to prevent them from being defanged, backdoored, persecuted, or regulated into docility.\n\n\nWe need an intellectual arsenal to fight the already-very-much-underway backlash by that sadly large cohort in every place and time that wants to be coerced.\n\n\nNor can even the most sublimely implemented blockchain hold the violence of the state at bay, at least not directly: they may never be able to block or reverse a single transaction, but they can send men with guns to your house and put you in a cage. They may even take your private keys in the process. A pervasive cultural sense that people have a right to transact helps reduce that risk. A law or constitutional amendment would be even better – while clearly recognizing that all of it would be meaningless absent the power of the protocols themselves.\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, if you're reading this and think your time is better spent building freedom-preserving cryptography – I agree. Put this down and get back to it. Please hurry.\n\n\nOnly a handful of people are likely to be raising that objection, though, and in any case, they're already sold on the arguments I care about. We share a fundamental commitment to the freedom to transact, they're just purists. (Or as they might put it, I'm a tourist.)\n\n\nOther, much larger groups of people will have different and more fundamental hesitations about the wisdom or usefulness of this 'right to transact.' In the rest of this essay, I'll attempt to address those as best I can. For now, here's the short version.\n\n\nFirst: the freedom to transact we enjoyed until very recently was a good thing. It deserves to be regarded as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. Doing so involves significant risks and tradeoffs, but the downsides are much exaggerated. Due process has downsides. Protections against unreasonable search and seizure have downsides. We accept them for good reason, and those who would erode these rights are usually concerned not so much with safety, fairness, justice and the rest, as they are with imposing control over a cowed populace. This is the case with the right to transact.\n\n\nSecond: this right, so long enjoyed in practice without being discussed, because it seemed natural and was hardly ever threatened, is now rapidly disappearing. This is a harmful process that should be stopped and reversed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Or if not, if abolishing the freedom to transact is somehow a good thing, the people who think so need to make their case. Taking away a freedom that has so thoroughly pervaded our lives should involve the democratic process. It shouldn't occur in silence as the result of a thousand small decisions by private firms and bureaucrats. Pass a law. (Or better yet, come and take it.)\n\n\nThird: we currently possess technologies that, properly deployed, maintained and adopted, will substantially restore and protect the right to transact. We should reject attempts, however well-intentioned, to muddy the waters about what cryptocurrency represents at this moment in history. Its drawbacks and growing pains, while real, are more than acceptable in the face of the alternative, which is to embrace our slide into perfect surveillance and financial unfreedom. There is no third option that pleases crypto's critics while preserving even a modicum of the freedom previous generations enjoyed.\n\n\nStarting with number one then:\n________________\nThe freedom to transact is a good thing\n\n\nFor if Power without laws, can make laws and change the Fundamentall laws of the Kingdome, I know not what subject in England can be secure of his life, or of any thing which he doth call his own.\n\n\nCharles I\n\n\n\n\nTrying to justify a basic moral truth in abstract terms is usually a bad idea. If personal experience, knowledge of history and a general moral framework can't convince you one way or the other on questions like the freedom of worship or the right to due process, a soup of latinate nouns isn't likely to do the trick.\n\n\nAppeals to empathy may have a better chance of success, but empathy won't spontaneously arise in someone who's lacked it so far. And those who enjoy the good graces of the powers that be – through whatever combination of luck, enthusiasm, docility and compromise – often struggle to imagine themselves at the wrong end of arbitrary power.\n\n\nIt's tempting, and perhaps wise, to simply reject the whole exercise. If people truly have a right to transact, say so and leave it at that. Agents and fans of state and corporate power will deny any such right exists, however sublime the arguments in its favor. And people who value individual liberty are likely to agree with the basic position, even if the arguments are nonsense.\nThe authors of the Declaration of Independence didn't tie themselves in philosophical knots over the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They called the whole package 'self-evident' – along with human equality, for good measure – and they moved on.\n\n\nSadly, I doubt I can get away with the kind of terse moral clarity the American founders used. The fact is that not everyone holds this truth – that all people should be free to transact – to be self-evident. Most people, through no fault of their own, don't know what it would even refer to. What do you mean, who's stopping you?\n\n\nAs I've argued, the issue hasn't been salient until now, given the capabilities at would-be oppressors' disposal. Cash, the quintessential means of free transaction, remains a fact of daily life. We don't learn in school about some bygone decade's fight to transact freely, because the clash is only beginning – assuming we put up any fight to speak of. The battle lines are mostly alien to the public forum, combining with more familiar fronts in the culture war to form an uncompelling scalene triangle. Accepting or hastening the end of the freedom to transact is, for the moment, the bipartisan default.[12]\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Declaration of Independence didn't instantly end the struggle for basic liberties through the power of stirring language alone. Seven more years of war were necessary to decide this 'self-evident' question.\nThe right to transact as prerequisite\nFor the most straightforward and perhaps the most convincing argument I've heard regarding the right to transact, I'm indebted to 6529. I prefer to phrase it in my own words, so please don't attribute any shortcomings in my formulation to him (?), but he deserves the credit for showing me how simple the question really is: once we're denied the right to transact, we're denied every other right by extension.[13]\n\n\nThe ability to buy and sell things is a prerequisite to rights we already regard as inalienable. Take the right to life: it becomes all but impossible to live when you can't buy food, pay for shelter, or sell goods and labor to obtain money in the first place.\n\n\nA person who isn't allowed to buy or rent a car, or pay for a bus or train ticket, can hardly be said to enjoy liberty. Someone barred from basic participation in the economy can't pursue happiness.\n\n\nRemove the right to transact, and you've in practice trampled on any other civil, human and constitutional right we might care to mention.\n\n\nTo be completely clear, I'm not describing a situation of poverty, though that would likely be the ultimate result of the situation I am describing: one in which a person has money, or easily could, but they've been cut off from the system that makes it usable. Their deposits are frozen; their means of sending a payment is disabled; their means of receiving a payment is disabled.\n\n\nI have in mind a situation in which money cannot meaningfully be owned except by its state or private-sector administrators, who grant access to it contingent on whatever criteria they choose.\n\n\nBut what would such a world – such a money – look like? That's hard to say definitively, since it's never existed.\nA thought experiment\nIt isn't difficult to imagine, though. Here's a situation that, given the trajectory of technological and political developments, an ordinary person could plausibly experience before the decade is out: without having been charged with any crime, much less convicted of one, she wakes up to find that her digital wallet no longer works.\n\n\nLet's call her Alice.\n\n\nAlice walks into a cafe in the morning, orders a coffee, and taps her phone to pay for it. A peevish vibration alerts her that the transaction has failed. The Federal Reserve wallet app (let's say she's American), containing all of her dollar deposits in the form of a central bank digital currency, has rejected the purchase. She doesn't carry physical cash, because the government no longer issues it or recognizes it as legal tender.\n\n\nShe tries again, and the phone buzzes again. An error message on her screen informs her, unhelpfully, that something has gone wrong. She drives to a gas station and the error repeats. She can no longer travel. The grocery store won't take her payment either. A week later, the lights and heat go out. She can't pay her utility bills, or for that matter her rent.\n\n\nIf Alice works outside the home, and she can't get to her workplace reliably or at all, she'll lose her job and income. If she works from home, her ability to do so will depend on her having, at a minimum, basic shelter and utilities, and realistically much more than that: the equipment and services she needs to perform her work, even if that's just a laptop with an internet connection.\n\n\nOf course, the question of having what she needs to work might be irrelevant. Let's assume the account freeze hasn't simply prevented Alice from sending money – it's blocked her from receiving it. Even if she could work, she couldn't be paid.\n\n\nA credit card might help fend off the crisis for a few weeks or months, but if her digital dollar wallet remains locked, those bills will go unpaid, and that means of transacting will disappear as well. Nor does it seem likely that the card company would extend credit to someone whose central bank wallet had been shut off.\n\n\nAlice may have no method of finding out why she can't send or receive money. Huge, unaccountable institutions often decline to explain their motives. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that some explanation is provided.\n\n\nWhat could a satisfactory explanation be? What could justify this treatment?\n\n\nWhat could Alice have done – or failed to do – such that a constitutional democracy, subject to the rule of law, could countenance this response? Perhaps an especially vicious crime would, set in the scales of justice, balance out this fate more or less. But if Alice were a dangerous criminal, a menace to those around her, the solution wouldn't be to leave her out on the street, free to commit further acts of depraved violence. It would be to incarcerate her.\n\n\nSimply removing Alice's ability to obtain the necessities of life doesn't protect her neighbors. If anything it endangers them more: now she's not just a violent criminal, but a violent criminal deprived of all legal means of getting food and shelter. Nor does the punishment serve to reform or rehabilitate her. There are those who see prison as a barbaric institution to be abolished entirely; somehow I doubt they'd see removal from the economy as a viable alternative.\n\n\nIf Alice were a fraudster, a Madoff who'd committed financial crimes, this punishment might have a certain karmic ring to it. But it would be unconstitutional: the Eighth Amendment bars the justice system from imposing ironic sentences like folktale genies.\n\n\nIt's difficult to imagine treating someone this way for any reason, which seems to me a serviceable, if inside-out, definition of a right. We would not, for any reason, forbid someone to espouse a particular faith; in other words, we recognize the freedom of worship. We would not strip someone of the ability to use their nation's currency; in other words, we recognize the freedom to transact.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the right to transact doesn't make any given good or service automatically legal to buy or sell. Illegal items and activities would remain illegal. You are not, nor should you be, allowed to possess a collection of potent nerve agents. But we might add, without any contradiction, that it would be absurd to revoke your permission to use money, based on the assumption – however well-founded – that you would use it to buy potent nerve agents.\nTerms of service\nSuch an approach would of course be expedient for law enforcement and financial institutions, but their convenience shouldn't define what a liberal society does and doesn't allow. We can't accept preemptive asset freezing any more than we would accept a person having their right to free speech preemptively revoked, based on the idea – again, however well-founded – that their ravings might give rise to something illegal.\n\n\nAnd yet making the lives of cops and compliance officers easy is exactly what lies at the root, not just of Alice's hypothetical hell, but of a growing number of real people's (more on that later).\n\n\nThere are clear precedents for treating people in similar ways. Social media companies routinely remove content and ban users who engage in perfectly legal, but ugly or inconvenient, speech. Unacceptable as the platforms' behavior may be according to any good-faith interpretation of democratic, constitutional principles, such expedients became the norm in less than a decade.[14] It is convenient for powerful people and wholly satisfactory to powerful political coalitions. Unsurprisingly, no one has stopped it.\n\n\nReturning to the question of what Alice might have done to deserve her fate, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that she somehow violated the Fed's terms of service. We posited that she wasn't charged with a crime. If she had been – or rather, if she'd been convicted – she might justly suffer unpleasant consequences, though summary removal from the economy would be a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.\n\n\nThe idea that a court would let a convicted criminal remain physically free, but strip them of the ability legally to obtain basic necessities, is – thankfully – unrealistic. What's depressingly plausible is this scenario: aided by constant surveillance, a bureaucrat ";

Centralized control over the ability to buy and sell was impossible, as was centralized surveillance of individual transactions.\n\n\nThis freedom was a good thing, and now, as a result of rapidly evolving technology, it's disappearing.\n\n\nThe Canadian government has invoked emergency powers to freeze protesters' bank accounts without due process. PayPal has declared its intention to monitor users' speech and fine them for expressing views the company considers objectionable. \n\n\nAcross the industrialized world, central banks are planning to replace national currencies with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These will enable states to track and, if they wish, block or reverse any monetary transaction, no matter how trivial.\n\n\nWe can't accept this outcome. The freedom to transact needs to be seen as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. To do otherwise risks forfeiting protections we once took for granted against potentially horrific abuse: the ability to earn money and spend it on daily necessities without seeking the approval of powerful, unaccountable institutions.\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\nABI\n	Application Binary Interface\n	AI\n	Artificial Intelligence\n	Bacen\n	Central Bank of Brazil\n	BIS\n	Bank for International Settlements\n	BOE\n	Bank of England\n	CBDC\n	Central Bank Digital Currency\n	CCP\n	Chinese Communist Party\n	CISA\n	Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency\n	DHS\n	Department of Homeland Security\n	DLT\n	Distributed Ledger Technology\n	DMV\n	Department of Motor Vehicles\n	ECB\n	European Central Bank\n	ESG\n	Environmental, Social, Governance\n	EVM\n	Ethereum Virtual Machine\n	FBI\n	Federal Bureau of Investigation\n	Fed\n	Federal Reserve\n	IMF\n	International Monetary Fund\n	IoT\n	Internet of Things\n	IRS\n	Internal Revenue Service\n	KYC/AML\n	Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering\n	NSA\n	National Security Agency\n	OSG\n	Office of the Surgeon General\n	SAR\n	Suspicious Activity Report\n	UBI\n	Universal Basic Income\n	WEF\n	World Economic Forum\n	________________\nDefinitions\n\n\nThis essay will make frequent use of a few terms that might not be familiar. They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.\nCensorship resistance\nCensorship resistance refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.\n\n\nNo messaging app, however, is fully censorship-proof. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: censorship-resistant.\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.\n\n\nCensorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as non-confiscatable.\n\n\nAn example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.\n\n\nI should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.\n\n\nBitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like\n\nbc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj\n\n– and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.)\nPermissionlessness\nPermissionlessness refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're permissioned): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.\n\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are centralized. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.\n\n\nBitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.\n\n\nDecentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.\n________________\n\n\nInitial thoughts\n\n\nImagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.\n\n\nSuzuha\n\n\n\n\nA right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them rights in the first place.\n\n\nWe say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.\n\n\nBy the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.\n\n\nCertainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.\n\n\nAnd granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.\n\n\nSo why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.\n\n\nIf people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.\n\n\nThe other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.\n\n\nSuch permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.\n\n\nBut shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.[1] But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.\n\n\nTake speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.\n\n\nIn recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.\n\n\nOn the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.\n\n\nAfter the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.[2] From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.\n\n\nToday powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.[3] Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.\n\n\nOrdinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.\nMeanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'[4]) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.\n\n\nComplex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.\n\n\nPhil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:\n\n\n'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'[5]\n\n\nToday, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.\n\n\nToday we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.\n\n\nTechnological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.\n\n\nA state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.\n\n\nWe need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.\n\n\nWithin recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.[6])\n\n\nCredit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.\n\n\nNo one used payment apps. No one used any apps.\n\n\nThe beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.\n\n\nBy and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.\n\n\nSeveral factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.\nBut I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.\n\n\nToday, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.\n\n\nIn any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.\n\n\nGiven past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,[7] but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.\n\n\nThe topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.\n\n\nTo the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.\n\n\nThe generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.\n\n\nOrwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.\n\n\nTo revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological cont";

The book, which to be clear, had already been written, took a year to be hand-copied and transported over the Alps.\n\n\nThat was the velocity at which the two most powerful men in western Europe, the heirs of Peter the apostle and Caesar Augustus, could transmit information. Both would have been flummoxed by our anxiety over the instantaneous, global spread of heresy – sorry, misinformation – via light pulsing through massive cables at the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nTwelve centuries later, people's grasp of current and emerging technological capabilities is so unevenly distributed that we walk the earth simultaneously with Charlemagnes, Morses, Daguerres, Bells, Diffies and Berners-Lees.[8] Some of us, including the most powerful among us, don't consider how control of digital payment rails could pose a threat to anyone; others are launching us into a future so new and strange that vanishingly few people understand the risks and opportunities. Likely they themselves don't understand.\n\n\nWe won't have centuries to figure out the implications of credit cards – to say nothing of fully programmable money under centralized bureaucratic control in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\nCBDCs are one of the main concerns of this essay, and I'll go into borderline-excessive detail about them later on, but briefly: they are digital currency issued directly by central banks. Take Europe as an example. The European Central Bank issues the euro, and for the most part, euros are already digital; physical coins and bills make up a fraction of the total value of the currency. But the 'digital euro,' or whatever it ends up being called, will mark a sharp departure from how the euro works today.\n\n\nAs a CBDC, it will incorporate a complete record of every transaction in which it's used. This record will be available to bureaucrats and, by extension, politicians and law enforcement. Today, your bank knows when you spend euros deposited with them, or receive them to your account. But the central bank and the rest of the EU government don't know. They likely have some idea – perhaps more than you think – but their picture is necessarily incomplete.\n\n\nWith a CBDC, the state will receive a complete, real-time stream of all transaction data. Following the elimination of cash – a goal closely associated with the introduction of CBDCs – there will be no legal way to transact outside of this government panopticon.\n\n\nThe state will also be able to control CBDC transactions: freeze your account, confiscate your funds, prevent you from sending money to or receiving it from certain parties – whoever the state deems unfit. The rules governing how money works could in principle be arbitrarily complex and liable to change at any time.\n\n\nBanks can act this way today, and sometimes they do – often enough, when they do, it's at the behest of the state. But with a CBDC, the government will be able to intervene directly – no need to go through private-sector intermediaries who might make a fuss. Arbitrary limitations on the freedom to transact and summary seizures of funds might of course be illegal, but the question could quickly become academic. When violating the law at scale becomes so easy, the government might be hard to convince to do otherwise, especially when it can instantly revoke its critics' ability to buy food.\n\n\nFor the moment, CBDCs are more idea than reality. But world leaders are openly discussing their development and introduction. China is already testing a prototype at scale. The Bahamas has deployed one nationwide, the only country to do so – although almost no one uses it. In Europe and the U.S., bureaucratic and legislative wheels are turning. Journalists are being primed.\n\n\nThe same Turing completeness that lets you build a website that can look like anything and do anything with any data you give it, will determine the degree to which currency can be configured, manipulated and controlled. Drain the account of a single dissident; confiscate $200 from every resident of Los Angeles; give $50 to anyone who voted a certain way – hell, anyone born in July. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nOf course nothing is (entirely) new under the sun. Authorities have been seizing and doling out assets for millennia: the story of the Knights Templar comes to mind as a dramatic and well-known pre-modern example of punitive confiscation. But if Philip IV of France could seize the bodies and assets of 100-something individuals, he could never have dreamed of issuing an order that would render all the coinage in an entire district worthless instantly.\n\n\nThat's the sort of fearsome miracle central banks might be able to carry out in a few years: update a database row, tweak a configuration, perhaps for the really tough cases, write a few lines of code, et voilà.\n\n\nAs Matt Odell, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, has written, the preferred interface for this kind of thing is likely to be an AI chat bot, which 'seems ideal for weaponizing massive surveillance databases way more efficiently than current search tools.' (He provides an example input: 'close the bank accounts of anyone who went to the anti government protest in Paris last week.')[9]\n\n\nBy combining streams of near-perfect surveillance, the state will be able to view an individual's physical movements, reading material, expressions of opinion, social interactions and monetary transactions as a unified whole. They will have the ability to instantaneously throttle or halt the economic activity of individual dissidents and entire social groups.\n\n\nIn the U.S., this outcome still lies somewhere over the horizon – how far is anyone's guess – and may even be avoided to some appreciable degree. In China, this reality has already begun to take shape.\n\n\nBeginning in April 2022, banks in the central Chinese province of Henan suspended cash withdrawals, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without access to their savings. The following month, hundreds of protesters traveled to Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, to demand the return of their money. When they planned to repeat the protest that June, however, many found themselves unable to leave their homes. The government had falsely diagnosed them with covid, flipping the health codes on the would-be protesters' phones to red. Under the draconian lockdown regime in place in China at that time, this was the equivalent of placing them under house arrest.[10]\n\n\nThe mechanism for social control in this case wasn't a CBDC – though China has been actively testing one in a growing number of provinces since 2020 – but it's easy enough to see the template behind these actions: centralized institutions (according to protesters, the banks are connected to political power brokers) seize people's assets, then prevent their victims from causing trouble by restricting their movements.\n\n\nBoth steps could be accomplished more efficiently using a CBDC: you can go protest in Zhengzhou, no problem, as long as you don't need to pay for transportation or fuel or food.\n\n\nFortunately, even as new technologies are enabling sinister authoritarianism, they are providing a means of escape. A parallel financial system built on cryptocurrency protocols has begun to take shape. This system has defied censorship or control by even the most determined and powerful global actors, and it's only becoming stronger and more resilient. (Its relationship to surveillance is complex, simplifying it at times, frustrating at others, but it effectively thwarts attempts at censorship.)\n\n\nProponents of the emerging crypto financial system often stress the minimization of trust: you don't control your crypto assets when a custodian has promised to hold them for you, or the courts have vowed to protect them, or the architects of the system have assured you its source code is safe and benign. You control your crypto assets when, and only when, you're the only one in control of the cryptographic keys, and the software encoding the system is open for you and all the world to scrutinize, tinker with and attack.\n\n\nThis is all perfectly true. And it goes some way towards accomplishing a laudable goal: obviating the whole discussion of 'rights,' at least as far as money is concerned. Bankers, payment processors, politicians and bureaucrats will respect the sanctity of your rights, right up until the moment they don't. Ethereum, bitcoin and their ilk are machines. You can see the code they run on, and those are the rules. They are indifferent to moral panics, social engineering, dot plots and managerial maneuvering.\n\n\nThis description does not, of course, apply equally well to all cryptocurrencies, some of which are very much centralized. At the time of writing, though, protocols such as bitcoin and ethereum are credibly decentralized, neutral and censorship-resistant. Nor am I aware of a technology outside of cryptocurrency that accomplishes anything comparable.\n\n\nIf the technology exists to escape the slide into financial tyranny, then why write a polemic about the right to transact? Will invoking a slogan protect our freedoms better than building decentralized, censorship-resistant systems? Wouldn't my time be better spent implementing the latest research into, say, zero-knowledge proofs – or the nearest thing my skill set allows?\n\n\nDon't cypherpunks write code?[11]\n\n\nMy answer is that our technological arsenal is critical, but not enough on its own. We need social consensus on what the technology means and what ends it serves. Do elliptic curves care about our ideologies? Of course not. The shapes rotate on, elegant, indifferent, unstoppable. E pur si muove. But without an ideological, moral, political – in short, a memetic – component, we can't make the case for adopting these technologies at scale. We can't develop arguments to prevent them from being defanged, backdoored, persecuted, or regulated into docility.\n\n\nWe need an intellectual arsenal to fight the already-very-much-underway backlash by that sadly large cohort in every place and time that wants to be coerced.\n\n\nNor can even the most sublimely implemented blockchain hold the violence of the state at bay, at least not directly: they may never be able to block or reverse a single transaction, but they can send men with guns to your house and put you in a cage. They may even take your private keys in the process. A pervasive cultural sense that people have a right to transact helps reduce that risk. A law or constitutional amendment would be even better – while clearly recognizing that all of it would be meaningless absent the power of the protocols themselves.\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, if you're reading this and think your time is better spent building freedom-preserving cryptography – I agree. Put this down and get back to it. Please hurry.\n\n\nOnly a handful of people are likely to be raising that objection, though, and in any case, they're already sold on the arguments I care about. We share a fundamental commitment to the freedom to transact, they're just purists. (Or as they might put it, I'm a tourist.)\n\n\nOther, much larger groups of people will have different and more fundamental hesitations about the wisdom or usefulness of this 'right to transact.' In the rest of this essay, I'll attempt to address those as best I can. For now, here's the short version.\n\n\nFirst: the freedom to transact we enjoyed until very recently was a good thing. It deserves to be regarded as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. Doing so involves significant risks and tradeoffs, but the downsides are much exaggerated. Due process has downsides. Protections against unreasonable search and seizure have downsides. We accept them for good reason, and those who would erode these rights are usually concerned not so much with safety, fairness, justice and the rest, as they are with imposing control over a cowed populace. This is the case with the right to transact.\n\n\nSecond: this right, so long enjoyed in practice without being discussed, because it seemed natural and was hardly ever threatened, is now rapidly disappearing. This is a harmful process that should be stopped and reversed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Or if not, if abolishing the freedom to transact is somehow a good thing, the people who think so need to make their case. Taking away a freedom that has so thoroughly pervaded our lives should involve the democratic process. It shouldn't occur in silence as the result of a thousand small decisions by private firms and bureaucrats. Pass a law. (Or better yet, come and take it.)\n\n\nThird: we currently possess technologies that, properly deployed, maintained and adopted, will substantially restore and protect the right to transact. We should reject attempts, however well-intentioned, to muddy the waters about what cryptocurrency represents at this moment in history. Its drawbacks and growing pains, while real, are more than acceptable in the face of the alternative, which is to embrace our slide into perfect surveillance and financial unfreedom. There is no third option that pleases crypto's critics while preserving even a modicum of the freedom previous generations enjoyed.\n\n\nStarting with number one then:\n________________\nThe freedom to transact is a good thing\n\n\nFor if Power without laws, can make laws and change the Fundamentall laws of the Kingdome, I know not what subject in England can be secure of his life, or of any thing which he doth call his own.\n\n\nCharles I\n\n\n\n\nTrying to justify a basic moral truth in abstract terms is usually a bad idea. If personal experience, knowledge of history and a general moral framework can't convince you one way or the other on questions like the freedom of worship or the right to due process, a soup of latinate nouns isn't likely to do the trick.\n\n\nAppeals to empathy may have a better chance of success, but empathy won't spontaneously arise in someone who's lacked it so far. And those who enjoy the good graces of the powers that be – through whatever combination of luck, enthusiasm, docility and compromise – often struggle to imagine themselves at the wrong end of arbitrary power.\n\n\nIt's tempting, and perhaps wise, to simply reject the whole exercise. If people truly have a right to transact, say so and leave it at that. Agents and fans of state and corporate power will deny any such right exists, however sublime the arguments in its favor. And people who value individual liberty are likely to agree with the basic position, even if the arguments are nonsense.\nThe authors of the Declaration of Independence didn't tie themselves in philosophical knots over the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They called the whole package 'self-evident' – along with human equality, for good measure – and they moved on.\n\n\nSadly, I doubt I can get away with the kind of terse moral clarity the American founders used. The fact is that not everyone holds this truth – that all people should be free to transact – to be self-evident. Most people, through no fault of their own, don't know what it would even refer to. What do you mean, who's stopping you?\n\n\nAs I've argued, the issue hasn't been salient until now, given the capabilities at would-be oppressors' disposal. Cash, the quintessential means of free transaction, remains a fact of daily life. We don't learn in school about some bygone decade's fight to transact freely, because the clash is only beginning – assuming we put up any fight to speak of. The battle lines are mostly alien to the public forum, combining with more familiar fronts in the culture war to form an uncompelling scalene triangle. Accepting or hastening the end of the freedom to transact is, for the moment, the bipartisan default.[12]\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Declaration of Independence didn't instantly end the struggle for basic liberties through the power of stirring language alone. Seven more years of war were necessary to decide this 'self-evident' question.\nThe right to transact as prerequisite\nFor the most straightforward and perhaps the most convincing argument I've heard regarding the right to transact, I'm indebted to 6529. I prefer to phrase it in my own words, so please don't attribute any shortcomings in my formulation to him (?), but he deserves the credit for showing me how simple the question really is: once we're denied the right to transact, we're denied every other right by extension.[13]\n\n\nThe ability to buy and sell things is a prerequisite to rights we already regard as inalienable. Take the right to life: it becomes all but impossible to live when you can't buy food, pay for shelter, or sell goods and labor to obtain money in the first place.\n\n\nA person who isn't allowed to buy or rent a car, or pay for a bus or train ticket, can hardly be said to enjoy liberty. Someone barred from basic participation in the economy can't pursue happiness.\n\n\nRemove the right to transact, and you've in practice trampled on any other civil, human and constitutional right we might care to mention.\n\n\nTo be completely clear, I'm not describing a situation of poverty, though that would likely be the ultimate result of the situation I am describing: one in which a person has money, or easily could, but they've been cut off from the system that makes it usable. Their deposits are frozen; their means of sending a payment is disabled; their means of receiving a payment is disabled.\n\n\nI have in mind a situation in which money cannot meaningfully be owned except by its state or private-sector administrators, who grant access to it contingent on whatever criteria they choose.\n\n\nBut what would such a world – such a money – look like? That's hard to say definitively, since it's never existed.\nA thought experiment\nIt isn't difficult to imagine, though. Here's a situation that, given the trajectory of technological and political developments, an ordinary person could plausibly experience before the decade is out: without having been charged with any crime, much less convicted of one, she wakes up to find that her digital wallet no longer works.\n\n\nLet's call her Alice.\n\n\nAlice walks into a cafe in the morning, orders a coffee, and taps her phone to pay for it. A peevish vibration alerts her that the transaction has failed. The Federal Reserve wallet app (let's say she's American), containing all of her dollar deposits in the form of a central bank digital currency, has rejected the purchase. She doesn't carry physical cash, because the government no longer issues it or recognizes it as legal tender.\n\n\nShe tries again, and the phone buzzes again. An error message on her screen informs her, unhelpfully, that something has gone wrong. She drives to a gas station and the error repeats. She can no longer travel. The grocery store won't take her payment either. A week later, the lights and heat go out. She can't pay her utility bills, or for that matter her rent.\n\n\nIf Alice works outside the home, and she can't get to her workplace reliably or at all, she'll lose her job and income. If she works from home, her ability to do so will depend on her having, at a minimum, basic shelter and utilities, and realistically much more than that: the equipment and services she needs to perform her work, even if that's just a laptop with an internet connection.\n\n\nOf course, the question of having what she needs to work might be irrelevant. Let's assume the account freeze hasn't simply prevented Alice from sending money – it's blocked her from receiving it. Even if she could work, she couldn't be paid.\n\n\nA credit card might help fend off the crisis for a few weeks or months, but if her digital dollar wallet remains locked, those bills will go unpaid, and that means of transacting will disappear as well. Nor does it seem likely that the card company would extend credit to someone whose central bank wallet had been shut off.\n\n\nAlice may have no method of finding out why she can't send or receive money. Huge, unaccountable institutions often decline to explain their motives. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that some explanation is provided.\n\n\nWhat could a satisfactory explanation be? What could justify this treatment?\n\n\nWhat could Alice have done – or failed to do – such that a constitutional democracy, subject to the rule of law, could countenance this response? Perhaps an especially vicious crime would, set in the scales of justice, balance out this fate more or less. But if Alice were a dangerous criminal, a menace to those around her, the solution wouldn't be to leave her out on the street, free to commit further acts of depraved violence. It would be to incarcerate her.\n\n\nSimply removing Alice's ability to obtain the necessities of life doesn't protect her neighbors. If anything it endangers them more: now she's not just a violent criminal, but a violent criminal deprived of all legal means of getting food and shelter. Nor does the punishment serve to reform or rehabilitate her. There are those who see prison as a barbaric institution to be abolished entirely; somehow I doubt they'd see removal from the economy as a viable alternative.\n\n\nIf Alice were a fraudster, a Madoff who'd committed financial crimes, this punishment might have a certain karmic ring to it. But it would be unconstitutional: the Eighth Amendment bars the justice system from imposing ironic sentences like folktale genies.\n\n\nIt's difficult to imagine treating someone this way for any reason, which seems to me a serviceable, if inside-out, definition of a right. We would not, for any reason, forbid someone to espouse a particular faith; in other words, we recognize the freedom of worship. We would not strip someone of the ability to use their nation's currency; in other words, we recognize the freedom to transact.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the right to transact doesn't make any given good or service automatically legal to buy or sell. Illegal items and activities would remain illegal. You are not, nor should you be, allowed to possess a collection of potent nerve agents. But we might add, without any contradiction, that it would be absurd to revoke your permission to use money, based on the assumption – however well-founded – that you would use it to buy potent nerve agents.\nTerms of service\nSuch an approach would of course be expedient for law enforcement and financial institutions, but their convenience shouldn't define what a liberal society does and doesn't allow. We can't accept preemptive asset freezing any more than we would accept a person having their right to free speech preemptively revoked, based on the idea – again, however well-founded – that their ravings might give rise to something illegal.\n\n\nAnd yet making the lives of cops and compliance officers easy is exactly what lies at the root, not just of Alice's hypothetical hell, but of a growing number of real people's (more on that later).\n\n\nThere are clear precedents for treating people in similar ways. Social media companies routinely remove content and ban users who engage in perfectly legal, but ugly or inconvenient, speech. Unacceptable as the platforms' behavior may be according to any good-faith interpretation of democratic, constitutional principles, such expedients became the norm in less than a decade.[14] It is convenient for powerful people and wholly satisfactory to powerful political coalitions. Unsurprisingly, no one has stopped it.\n\n\nReturning to the question of what Alice might have done to deserve her fate, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that she somehow violated the Fed's terms of service. We posited that she wasn't charged with a crime. If she had been – or rather, if she'd been convicted – she might justly suffer unpleasant consequences, though summary removal from the economy would be a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.\n\n\nThe idea that a court would let a convicted criminal remain physically free, but strip them of the ability legally to obtain basic necessities, is – thankfully – unrealistic. What's depressingly plausible is this scenario: aided by constant surveillance, a bureaucrat ";

It expels the person responsible without providing any form of recourse or due process: Your account has been flagged for unusual activity. Please contact our support team to resolve this issue. The support team is an AI chat bot that might as well be a stone wall, and there's no way to speak to a human being.\n\n\nWelcome to the black market.\n\n\nThe offenses for which a person might be removed from the payments infrastructure are unlikely to have been clearly enumerated by a democratically elected legislature. More likely they'll be written by employees of a federal agency, or the Federal Reserve, or a private-sector firm to which CBDC development has been contracted out. These rules almost certainly won't be limited in scope or subject to more than symbolic oversight. Rather, they're likely to include the sort of any other unacceptable conduct, as solely determined by us language familiar to the dozen or so people who have actually read a terms of service agreement all the way through.\nEnds and means\nIn some ways the preceding hypothetical is a bit extreme: most likely, relatively few individuals would be totally removed from a CBDC economy. Remove too many people entirely, and the black market will outstrip the approved one.\n\n\nRather than focus too much on the unfortunate few who would be entirely excommunicated, let's consider the far greater numbers who would be subject to subtler infringements of their freedom.\n\n\nHaving lacked the option to instantaneously fine-tune entire populations' access to money, it's hard to say exactly what policymakers would choose to do with this ability. There are no straightforward precedents. Still, it's worth speculating. Sooner or later we'll arrive at a juncture where politicians and bureaucrats do enjoy these capabilities, in some countries if not most, so we should devote some thought to what they might do with them.\n\n\nPresumably, at least in the beginning, they would pursue benign-sounding goals. We can imagine a few possibilities: encouraging healthy, sustainable eating; discouraging drug and alcohol abuse; boosting favored industries; giving historically marginalized groups a leg up; and keeping inflation and unemployment in check.\n\n\nYou may find that your spending on fresh produce is subsidized with little discounts to encourage a healthy diet. Same, perhaps, for plant-based meat substitutes. You might find, by contrast, that the five pounds of steak you wanted to buy for a birthday barbecue trigger a penalty, or even rejection: three pounds of red meat is the most you can purchase in a week. Perhaps your third trip to the bar or casino this week similarly fails. Or maybe your phone's accelerometer, GPS and other sensors come to the conclusion that you've been indulging in cocaine again, and it's time to throttle your spending for 36 hours so you can rethink your choices.\n\n\nPerhaps, in line with the Fed's attempts to lower unemployment and raise consistently below-target inflation (those were the days), a negative interest rate has been put in place, with the result that your deposits automatically fall by 0.5% per year.\n\n\nPerhaps, in order to reduce wealth inequality or discourage premature retirement, each dollar saved comes with a 20-year expiration date. \n\n\nOr perhaps a recent 'police-involved shooting' has led to protests in your part of town. Wallets in the area might be frozen until the crowds disperse – or even, to teach the querulous districts a lesson, a bit longer.\n\n\nIt's easy to imagine that no one will be entirely free to spend their money on legal goods and services as they please. All money will to some degree resemble food stamps: not a uniform, neutral and universal means of exchange, but a form of coupon subject to complex, changing and humiliating rules. Your purchasing power will be a function of the government's opinion of your decision-making abilities.\n\n\nUnlike food stamps, though, the restrictions need not apply to all recipients in the same way. Favored people will obtain favored objects more easily. Disfavored people will need to justify their choices, and disfavored objects of desire will become harder to obtain. Nothing in principle would stop such restrictions from taking the minutest individual circumstances into account: limits to your freedom to transact could be targeted with the precision of social media ads.\n\n\nThis is of course far too much power for anyone to have over the medium of exchange. The state cannot be allowed to intrude into every economic event, however minute, and not just as a spectator, but as the final arbiter of that transaction's acceptability.\n\n\nBefore moving on, I should stress that the above – even if it sounds awful – is a relatively optimistic scenario. It's a vision of the sort of bumbling, manageably corrupt, blinkered, corporatized, residually competent state typical of Western democracies circa 2023.\n\n\nBut there's no guarantee this situation persists even in the medium term. When a government veers sharply towards totalitarianism of whatever sort – communist, fascist, theocratic or in thrall to some fresh horror – it will enjoy the same fearsome control over payment systems as its on-the-whole democratic predecessor.\n\n\nThe ability to interfere with people's freedom to transact, once obtained, will outlast any particular government or form of government. Even if liberal democracy writ large enjoys centuries of continued vigor, a few countries will fall into totalitarianism along the way. Anyone living in a constitutional democracy should hesitate to build a CBDC or any similar system – certainly for their own sakes, but also for their children's.\n\n\nAnd in any case, such a level of centralized control in itself can't help but alter the basic character of the state. The capabilities of centralized programmable currencies will change constitutional democracy in significant and unpredictable ways, assuming they don't simply destroy it.\nWorse-case scenarios \nLet's imagine this system in the hands of a more straightforwardly ruthless regime. First, we should acknowledge that the system can be combined with hyper-accurate personal data of any sort: location data, browsing history, social media interactions, calls, texts, medical records, 'smart home' audio recordings, footage from security cameras (equipped with facial recognition), genetic data. All of this data can then be synthesized, organized and interpreted with the aid of artificial intelligence.\n\n\nAny government will eventually attempt to bring these methods of surveillance and analysis together into a more or less coherent apparatus. (Success is of course not guaranteed.) But the more straightforwardly power-hungry the state, the more quickly it will do so, and the less compunction it will have about, say, barring you from renting in a certain neighborhood due to the contents of your genome.\n\n\nDictators have long seized and doled out assets to win support or punish dissent. Equipped with full visibility into and control over transactions, they'll be able to do so with ease and precision. Disfavored groups – be they long-oppressed or former oppressors – could find themselves, if not simply robbed, then fleeced by inflated prices, or barred from obtaining scarce or desirable goods. The malicious logic of the Jim Crow-era shop owner who quotes one price for a white customer and another, higher one for a black customer could be built into the means of exchange itself.\n\n\nThose marginalized by the state could be hemmed into ghettos by geographically delineated permissions to shop, rent, work, or get transportation. Even merchants and landlords who opposed such controls couldn't easily protest them: the transactions would simply fail. Nor does the control of movement need to be purely spatial: leaders will be able to impose targeted lockdowns and curfews using the same means (recall the protesting depositors' surprise covid diagnoses in Henan).\n\n\nAnd these restrictions could be arbitrarily fine-tuned. Using location data, the screws could be tightened on anyone who's frequented a particular house of worship – or failed to. The criteria for punishment could be anything: having purchased a certain book, downloaded a certain file, visited a certain clinic, immigrated from a certain country, attempted to emigrate to another one, purchased from a certain business – or better yet, failed to. Or it could be a matter of having spoken a bit too freely in the presence of a smartphone microphone.\n\n\nI'm hardly the first one to raise these concerns. Maya Zehavi, an Israeli founder and investor in the cryptocurrency industry, has written: 'The number one reason I'm against CBDC in the surveillance mode BIS is promoting - how my extended family managed to hide away money & gold to survive the ww2 in relative safety. The rising fascism across the world alongside brewing antisemitism means we need to support a web […] For the worst case scenario.'[15]\n\n\nIn order to avoid becoming a tool of repression, money needs to remain neutral and portable. Enforcing the law is all well and good. But what if it's against the law to be Jewish, Tutsi, Rohingya, Uyghur? Have modern states demonstrated the wisdom and humanity we'd expect of institutions aspiring to build CBDCs? \n\n\nIt's also important to stress that official neglect can be as harmful as official malice. Barring unprecedented feats of conscientiousness and efficiency on the part of the state, there will be many whose remoteness, poverty, lack of education, or mental or physical impairment will prevent them from gaining access to a CBDC in the first place. The state will have no particular quarrel with them – only a measure of contempt, when and if it remembers them. The result will be the same.\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, central bankers almost always cite 'financial inclusion' (access to a bank account and a means of payment) as a reason to adopt CBDCs.[16] It's true enough in principle that central banks could offer CBDC access to people who can't open accounts at private-sector banks.\n\n\nBut in what world is making the use of currency – in any form – contingent on clearing bureaucratic hurdles like identity verification an improvement on the status quo? As I'll discuss later on, central banks also tout the ability to surveil CBDC usage and root out money laundering and illicit activity as an advantage. To do so, by their own admission, they'd need to tie CBDC accounts to verified, government-issued IDs – exactly what many of today's financially excluded lack.\nMonopoly money\nNor will those excluded from the CBDC system, intentionally or not, be able to fall back on legacy forms of payment like cash – at least not legally. For the scheme to even plausibly accomplish policy goals, governments will need to ban physical cash.[17]\n\n\nSubsidies, taxes, interest rates, stimulus payments, fines, geographic restrictions, curfews, caps on holdings, expiration dates, surveillance – if alternatives to central bank digital money are allowed to persist, all of these tools lose at least some of their efficacy. Witness European central bankers' anxiety about (metaphorical, mostly) mattresses stuffed with cash, which made passing negative interest rates through to ordinary savers more or less impossible. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Andy Haldane floated a CBDC as a solution to this dilemma in a speech in 2015.[18]\n\n\nOf course, black market means of exchange will emerge. Loopholes and workarounds will be found within the system. Their exact forms will depend on the system's idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities, but they'll certainly make use of combinations of flawed software, gaps in surveillance, and human laziness and corruption.\n\n\nThere will also be parallel systems: physical or digital tokens more or less emulating cash will almost certainly circulate, but using them will invite punishment. For an idea of how little sense of humor the state is likely to have regarding alternate payment systems, see its reaction to tax evasion.\nTax evasion, money laundering and crime\nSpeaking of which, I should address a whole range of criticisms of my position. Collected under one heading, we might say: censorship-resistant, permissionless – in a word 'free' – transactions are, in fact, bad.\n\n\nPeople who argue the above might cite any combination of the following ills, all of which the freedom to transact does or at least could in principle facilitate: tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, smuggling, bribery, gambling, prostitution, trade in weapons, predatory lending, extortion, and terrorist financing. Apologies if I've forgotten anything: human creativity, in financial wrongdoing as in all things, is boundless.\n\n\nSmall-scale tax evasion would certainly become more difficult under a CBDC regime. Cash transactions make underreporting not just easy but, I've heard, tempting. Governments have long managed to collect taxes without the aid of a financial panopticon, though given the tenacity of tax evasion, a certain amount of frustration is understandable.\n\n\nModern states, more often than not, run grisly deficits, since they fail to tax at a rate anywhere near commensurate with their expenditures. (To do so would, at least in America, probably be impossible.) The incentive to build a system of total financial surveillance and control is clear, but I would argue that we simply can't consider tax evasion sufficient justification for the sort of regime that's being contemplated.\n\n\nAfter all, the ability to transact freely is nothing new: it's been the default for almost the entire time modern tax regimes have existed. Revenue collection has been imperfect as a result, but even so states have managed – at times – to keep debt within sustainable limits. When fiscal crises have occurred, the culprit has been war, unnecessary infrastructure projects, corruption, outright theft by the regime, or gambling by bankers far more often than it's been an especially tax-averse populace. Even where the tax take is abysmally low, the blame often lies with leaders who purchase political backing through low taxes and lax collection.\n\n\nEnding tax evasion, an unobjectionable goal in the abstract, would not prevent profligate states from spending their way into crisis. Nor would it merit the sacrifices in terms of freedom and human dignity the solution would demand. In any case, the most sophisticated and prolific tax avoiders would pursue technically legal means, the same as they do now. People who use cash to evade taxes hide thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in income; people who use offshore tax havens hide millions or tens of millions.\n\n\nMoney laundering is a similar story: in a perfect world, it would be unknown. A perfectly surveilled remote-control currency could conceivably put a stop to criminals' washing their proceeds through cash businesses, since cash wouldn't exist. But the stereotypical picture of money laundering through nail salons, strip clubs, pizza shops, or the classic laundromats – while I have no doubt it occurs – distorts the picture terribly.\n\n\nIndustrial-scale money laundering is performed not by these small, more or less seedy, cash-based businesses, but by huge multinational banks. These institutions are already subject to reams of regulation that require reporting and disclosure of 'suspicious' activity. They are as fully deputized to the financial surveillance apparatus as any sector could be, and yet the most cursory glance at their record in combating money laundering yields, well:\n\n• 'Wachovia pays $160 million to settle drug money probe' (2010)[19]\n\n\n• 'HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money-Laundering Charges' (2012)[20]\n\n\n• 'Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme' (2019)[21]\n\n\n• 'How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled' (2019)[22]\n\n\n• 'Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation' (2020)[23]\n\n\n• 'Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal' (2020)[24]\n\n\n• 'FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning' (2020)[25]\n\n\n• 'Bank of America insider charged with money laundering for BEC scams' (2021)[26]\n\n\n• 'US families sue Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, accuse them of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan' (2021)[27]\n\n\n• 'Credit Suisse found guilty in cocaine cash laundering case' (2022)[28]\n\n\nIt could be argued that these institutions, while subject to extensive and expensive post-9/11 know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, are simply ignoring them, and that imposing surveillance and control at the level of the individual transaction could force compliance.\n\n\nAs it turns out, though, the failure isn't the banks' alone. For the most part, they conduct the surveillance required by the American government, filing millions of 'suspicious activity reports' (SARs) with FinCEN, the division of the Treasury Department tasked with combating money laundering, every year. Each SAR filing sets in motion an intricate protocol, as BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported in 2020, whereby the government ignores the reports and … the end.[29]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey by the Bank Policy Institute, less than 4% of SARs 'warranted follow-up inquiries from law enforcement.'[30]\n\n\nThis hollow ritual allows the banks to 'comply' with regulations by filing the proper forms and, when American regulators say nothing, continue to launder blood money. It allows American bureaucrats and politicians to claim to be fighting terrorists, drug dealers and mobsters. Occasionally, perhaps because a bank has failed to file the proper forms, the bureaucrats impose the sort of fine that banks can easily view as a cost of doing business. These 'enforcement actions' allow the bureaucracy to publish a press release and the politicians to rail against banks, whose campaign contributions they, for the most part, continue to accept.\nWhat the ritual does not accomplish is stopping Mexican or Colombian drug cartels, or kleptocrats in Soviet successor states, or jihadist terrorists, or the operators of Ponzi schemes from cleaning their money. The most commonly cited estimate for the effectiveness of global anti-money laundering controls is in the range of 0.1-0.2% – one or two dollars in every thousand.[31] (This statistic also implies that other jurisdictions are no more effective than the U.S. in this regard.)\n\n\nWhat KYC/AML policies do accomplish is surveillance. FinCEN's 2020 report to Congress, in which it justifies its funding, repeatedly boasts that it has generated millions of reports of cash transactions, which are 'used to identify enforcement and investigative leads as well as strategic trends and patterns.'[32] Plainly, however, money laundering continues apace. The purpose of KYC/AML laws as they exist today is to enhance government surveillance of the financial system.\n\n\nSo it's no surprise that money laundering is being used to justify the creation of a system enabling total visibility into the entire field of economic activity: it's an old, successful playbook.\n\n\nProponents of CBDCs frequently claim that their introduction (and cash's elimination) would solve some of the financial system's most persistent and acute problems. In a paper cited by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution claim that 'the widespread use of CBDC and the obsolescence of paper currency would be helpful in discouraging tax evasion, money laundering, and other illegal activities.'[33]\n\n\nThe same claim is repeated in almost every favorable discussion of CBDCs, and it is almost certainly false. Particularly in the case of money laundering, policymakers have invoked the modern world's worst boogeymen to justify increasingly invasive scrutiny into individuals' finances. The system fails abjectly at accomplishing its stated goals,[34] but succeeds in gaining visibility into people's transactions – visibility that would be denied under normal constitutional procedures, whereby authorities who want to spy on people need to obtain warrants.\n\n\nIn an authoritarian tactic almost too cliché for parody, the state is demanding that we surrender basic freedoms in order to escape suspicion that we're drug dealers or terrorists.\nThe DMV\nSimilar logic has become so pervasive in the last couple of decades, it can be difficult to realize how strange and pernicious it really is.\n\n\nSo imagine the same way of thinking applied to driving: when you go to the DMV to renew your license, you're handed a tracking device you must attach to your car. Your movements – all of them – are recorded in a DMV database. Any time you drive more than 10 miles, the data from the journey is automatically reported to local, state and federal law enforcement (no need for them to request it, much less obtain a warrant).\n\n\nIf you travel more than 50 miles, or travel to a place you haven't been before, or make any stops in an area labeled 'suspicious' – there are many such areas, they change frequently, and you're responsible for knowing where they are – you need to file a Travel Justification Report and submit it to the DMV by fax. Repeated failure to do so could result in fines, suspension of your license, even jail time.\n\n\nIt's universally recognized that everyone who drives violates the rules daily. It's wildly impractical to comply with them all, and perhaps, given their complexity and overlap, actually impossible. As a result, you or anyone else could be punished at any time. You have little prospect of defending yourself: of course you've broken the rules, everyone has. The best way to protect yourself is to have friends at the DMV and police precinct.\n\n\nWhy are you being subjected to this bureaucratic lunacy? Because organized crime syndicates use roads to transport drugs. Because domestic extremists use roads to transport weapons and carry out terror attacks. Because human traffickers use roads to transport minors for sexual exploitation. What are you suggesting – that none of that matters?\nThe inevitable hack\nI've struggled to find the appropriate place to weave this next point into the argument, so I've left it as an inelegant close to this chapter. Then again, perhaps it makes sense as a jarring coda: in a way, that's what a hack is.\nEven if every worry I've expressed so far about CBDCs is misplaced, one bad outcome is all but inevitable: a substantial amount of the sensitive, valuable data collected through this new form of money will leak. The government will do its best to avoid a breach, and sooner or later it will fail.\n\n\nHackers will steal some or all of the transaction data, giving them potent leverage over people in positions of power, as well as countless ordinary people.\n\n\nLikely they'll be state-sponsored (hacking a government is generally not feasible for amateurs). There's precedent: beginning in 2014, Chinese government hackers obtained access to millions of personnel records held by the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management. The data was about as sensitive and valuable as any the state collects: it related to background checks conducted before granting security clearances to federal employees.[35] Such a haul is perfectly suited to facilitating the blackmail of U.S. officials by its most powerful adversary's intelligence agents, and still the government could not protect that information.\n\n\nStates should not be able to collect every detail of every payment conducted using their currency – because it's invasive, dangerous and unjust, but also because they can't be trusted to keep the data safe.\n\n\nNor is a spectacular attack by a rival superpower always necessary to create a breach. In 2018, the Tribune reported that access to Aadhaar, India's universal biometric identification scheme, was on sale to anyone who could pay. The paper's reporters were able to purchase not just the personal details of an individual or some chunk of individuals, but permission to search the entire database, containing highly sensitive information on over a billion people. The price was less than $10.[36]\nThe";

In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.\n\n\nChrystia Freeland\n\n\n\n\nYou might see the previous chapter as overly anxious extrapolation from current trends, if not paranoid fantasy. I'm arguing that we've begun a slide into a state of profound unfreedom, in which the ability to obtain any good or service depends on the whims of the state, which – even if it's benevolent and wise for the moment (it's not) – could easily become uncaring, misguided or actively malicious.\n\n\nBut even if you accept that we could slide into such a hell, you probably wish I'd offer some sort of evidence that the slide has begun. A lot of things could happen.\n\nUnfortunately, there is ample evidence that business and government leaders intend to introduce fully programmable, remote-control currencies, and to use this technology to pursue policy goals that large constituencies – if not majorities – of the people affected would oppose if given a say. To put it more bluntly: CBDCs are an end run around democratic processes – and potentially, a highly effective one.\n\n\nAll the more so because, again unfortunately, the majority of the electorate in the average liberal democracy has little to no idea that such projects are being planned. CBDCs are no secret: I haven't smuggled sensitive documents out of some Washington sub-sub-basement. Central bankers have churned out discussion papers, white papers, proposals and plans related to CBDCs since around 2014,[37] but the audience for this literature is the sort of person who knows what 'FOMC' stands for, what the FOMC does, and most of its members by name. To the vast majority, 'CBDC' is just one more in a sea of wonkish acronyms.\n\n\nNot infrequently, the financial media will report on these central bank publications, but the coverage is for the most part perfunctory and little more than a rewording of central bank statements – sometimes with a nod to abstract Concerns added for balance.\n\n\nReuters' article on 'digital dollar' pilots announced in 2021 is a model of this sort of coverage: it presents CBDCs as a straightforward modernization project meant to 'improve payment systems' and 'boost financial inclusion'; the notes of caution – the need to protect 'privacy and freedom of commerce' – are provided by the NGO running the pilot and the central bank itself, not critics or even plausibly neutral observers.[38]\n\n\nI can only blame the media so much: interest in the topic simply isn't there. It's irrelevant to the culture wars that keep contemporary media in business (which is ironic, given how potent a weapon in those same culture wars CBDCs are likely to become).[39]\n\n\nAnd the source material, unsurprisingly, is sanitary fare. It takes a measure of skepticism and imagination to see how the dollar, but digital could empower states in ways they simply shouldn't be empowered. Perhaps, reporters, editors and readers alike could be forgiven for thinking, it takes a bit too much skepticism and imagination.\n\n\nBut read the literature closely, and central bankers protest too much, making promises to maintain privacy and neutrality that inspire less confidence every time they're repeated. And sometimes, they make no such promises, laying out plainly how closely they intend to watch individual consumers' most quotidian transactions, and how they intend to censor the ones they deem undesirable.\n\n\nNor would it be much comfort if central bankers sincerely desired to protect the freedom to transact. (They don't.) If the systems they implement don't enforce such protections at the protocol level – if human decision-making is the only safeguard – then sooner or later the decision-makers will abuse the powers these systems afford them. As Charlie Munger put it, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.\n\n\nFor the time being, though, CBDCs remain in the discussion and planning phases. But even in the absence of CBDCs, we're faced with a growing list of concrete examples in which public- and private-sector actors abandon the principle – never so much a principle as the plain fact of a cash-first world – that money is a neutral medium. Private firms have increasingly adopted the view that, even though it violates no law or regulation, a given transaction should be subject to their approval, based on criteria they're free to devise in secret and revise on the fly. Politicians, bureaucrats and activists have encouraged these abuses, pushing firms to limit or revoke their customers' freedom to transact on transparently ideological grounds.\n\n\nCBDCs themselves, in other words, are not the whole issue. They are likely to be developed and adopted, but even if they aren't, powerful actors already possess the willingness and capability to limit the freedom to transact. The following examples deserve our attention because they demonstrate that fact, but also because they demonstrate the motivations, tactics and justifications of the people behind them – people who, if they themselves don't eventually control a CBDC, might inspire those who do.\nCanada\nIn February 2022, in response to protests against covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates that saw truckers blockade economically important southern border crossings, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked a law granting the government sweeping emergency powers.[40] Under this expanded remit, the government froze the financial assets of protesters and required credit card companies and fundraising platforms to report activity related to the protests to anti-money laundering authorities.\n\n\nStanding alongside Trudeau, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Finance, announced these measures at a press conference (emphasis mine):\n\n\n'In invoking the Emergencies Act, we are announcing the following immediate actions. First, we are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use. These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n'The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Our banks and financial institutions are already obligated to report to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FINTRAC.\n\n\n'As of today, all crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use must register with FINTRAC, and they must report large and suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. This will help mitigate the risk that these platforms receive illicit funds, increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC, and make more information available to support investigations by law enforcement into these illegal blockades.\n'We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy. The government will also bring forward legislation to provide these authorities to FINTRAC on a permanent basis.\n\n\n'Second, the government is issuing an order with immediate effect under the Emergencies Act authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts.\n\n\n'Third, we are directing Canadian financial institutions to review their relationships with anyone involved in the illegal blockades and report to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] or CSIS [Canadian Security Intelligence Service]. As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.\n\n'Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades.\n\n\n'This is about following the money. This is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades. We are today serving notice: if your truck is being used in these illegal blockades your corporate accounts will be frozen. The insurance on your vehicle will be suspended. Send your semi-trailers home. The Canadian economy needs them to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer.'[41]\n\n\nI hope you'll pardon the long quotation. I see Freeland's address as some of the most valuable primary source material related to the topic of this essay, both because it will be remembered as a turning point in the history of liberal democracies (hopefully in the direction of stronger protections for the right to transact), and because it perfectly captures the rhetoric and mentality of those who support increased surveillance of and control over payments.\n\n\nFreeland presented the government's gathering more data on its citizens' transactions as a good in itself ('increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC'). She presented the new controls as an extension of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules. Since it's difficult to see how the protesters were laundering money (my understanding is that money launderers try to avoid drawing attention to themselves), that leaves two possibilities: the protesters were terrorists (she may in fact have meant to imply this) or, to my mind, the more likely conclusion – that these laws, with their distractingly villainous names, have little to do with terrorists or money laundering, and everything to do with dragnet surveillance.\n\n\nShe made no attempt to present these measures as consistent with liberal democratic values, such as the presumption of innocence, the right to free assembly, or limitations on the government's ability to conduct searches and seizures.\n\n\nInstead, she made eight references to 'illegal blockades.' They almost certainly were illegal: civil disobedience is illegal by definition. But beyond that, there are limits to what any state or society can tolerate from its protesters, and the truckers may indeed have exceeded those limits. It's not my place to say. What I want to stress is that no court heard evidence regarding these protests or ruled them illegal. The laws they were accused of violating weren't specified. In the space of five minutes, a government minister declared the protesters' actions illegal; unveiled a new, unprecedented punishment for their crimes; and deputized private sector firms to root out and punish the perpetrators.\n\n\nNor was it an idle threat. A week into the state of emergency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that they had frozen 219 financial products, as well as 3.8 million Canadian dollars held by a payment processor. (By that time, according to the government, the process of unfreezing assets had begun.)[42]\n\n\nCanada's actions have no antecedent that I'm aware of in modern liberal democracies, but even so they elicited muted criticism. Mainstream outlets, at least in the U.S., paid little attention to this innovation in the maintenance of public order: using information obtained through warrantless surveillance of the financial system to cut off protesters' access to credit cards and bank accounts.\n\n\nThe lack of any official condemnation from other Western governments suggests they might at least consider pursuing similar measures to break up protests against their own policies. To state the obvious, there is no guarantee that such weaponization of the financial system will be limited to left-of-center governments like Trudeau's, or its victims to those aligned with the political right. Once these tools become available to them, governments of any persuasion will gladly use them against protesters of any description.\n\n\nCanadians will almost certainly hesitate to attend protests critical of the government from now on, since they know that they can be arrested and denied the means to pay bail – indeed, pay for anything. Their right to free assembly has been effectively eliminated, without any need to pass a law or create a spectacle through physical confrontations. \n\n\nThe people of other ostensibly liberal democracies might soon experience the same chilling effect, to the extent they haven't already, having seen Canada's example.\nPayPal\nOften, financial services providers are happy to surveil and punish their customers for the sorts of infractions the Canadian authorities went after, but without any prompting from the government. (At least, any public prompting.)\n\n\nPayPal, a private payment processor, has for years enforced an idiosyncratic moral code based not on the laws of any jurisdiction it happens to operate in, but its own opaque Terms of Service regime.\nIn 2020, Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director at the non-profit crypto advocacy group Coin Center, compiled a list of examples in which PayPal barred users from its platform for engaging in perfectly legal activity: OnlyFans models were prohibited from selling nude photos on the platform; independent journalists tracking the spread of covid in prisons were kicked off when Twitter flagged them for spreading misinformation; a website publishing files for 3D printing guns (protected speech) and selling related merch was banned (their Twitter account is also suspended).[43]\n\n\nThe ACLU has criticized PayPal for barring sex workers.[44] The company was accused of stalling efforts to raise bail money for Black Lives Matter protesters.[45] It shut a user out for making payments related to Tor nodes he was hosting.[46] A Canadian news outlet's payment for an article about Syrian refugees was blocked – apparently for mentioning the word 'Syria.'[47] PayPal froze WikiLeaks' account in 2010.[48]\n\n\nRecently, the company went beyond keeping users' funds in limbo, and signaled its intention to actually seize money from users who fall afoul of its rules.\nIn October 2022 PayPal said it would levy steep fines for a range of activities, including speech the company deemed unacceptable.[49] The language of the updated 'Acceptable Use Policy,' which would have gone into force the following month, labeled the 'sending, posting, or publication of messages, content, or materials that meet certain criteria' as 'prohibited activities' that could result in fines of $2,500. Among these 'certain criteria' was content found to 'promote misinformation.'\n\n\nA company whose purpose – at least in its customers' eyes – is to process payments, has taken upon itself the duty to monitor its customers' speech, judge that speech's merits according to criteria known to no one outside the company (in all likelihood, never explicitly defined anywhere), and if the speech is found wanting, seize its customers' funds as punishment.\n\n\nTo be clear, the procedure envisioned in this document wasn't to freeze funds or bar access to the platform. PayPal would have gone beyond even Canada's emergency measures and permanently confiscated its customers' money. (The document was pulled from PayPal's website, and the company claimed the proposed change was an 'error.')\n\n\nIf a state took these actions, we would be rightly outraged, but hardly surprised. Monarchs, emperors, high priests, generals and the like have all too frequently done this sort of thing. In enforcing their vision of truth, they've used economic measures along with other, grislier tactics. One could name any number of examples from any number of places, going back as far as recorded history permits.\n\n\nFor a private company to adopt this attitude, though, is strange. Having your assets confiscated for heresy is one thing, if the Church or King is doing it. If a democracy is doing it, you might (but shouldn't) comfort yourself with the notion that at least the censorship is of, by and for the people. For an online payments service to act this way, though, is something else entirely. PayPal is not a democratically accountable institution. Nor does any sort of social contract exist that could conceivably give it the right to punish crimes of conscience.\n\n\nThe situation is just silly. PayPal isn't yet 30 years old. It has 'pal' in the name. For an institution of this type this to freelance as Ministry of Truth would be a farce, except that it's part of a definite trend: Facebook, Google and Twitter have taken it upon themselves to determine – according to inconsistent, flighty standards that make scant reference to constitutional principles – what may and may not be said.\nThird parties\nWhy should these companies be empowered to enforce a superset of the law? It seems law enforcement bodies themselves have provided some of the impetus.\n\n\nCops in constitutional democracies are in theory constrained by protections like the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure. But American authorities, at least, have a convenient way around these hurdles: once a person voluntarily provides a third party with information (the way PayPal's customers provide it with their payments data), constitutional strictures fall away. Law enforcement can simply ask the company for the data, with no need to seek a search warrant from a court.\n\n\nThe company could refuse, of course, in which case the authorities are back to petitioning judges through the normal procedure envisioned in the Bill of Rights. But from the perspective of a heavily regulated financial services company, how is it in your interest to stand up for your customers' rights? The politicians and regulators who can make or break your thin margins with a couple well-aimed laws or rules don't, with rare exceptions, care about your customers' privacy. They actively resent it, to the extent it makes catching criminals, terrorists and 'extremists' – a term that tends to cover the whole of the political opposition – more difficult.\n\n\nOne might expect voters to enforce a concern for constitutional protections by electing lawmakers who care about such protections: after all, these voters are almost all customers of one or more financial services firms. But by and large, the electorate doesn't care either. They too would like to catch criminals, terrorists and extremists, and this is a perfectly healthy instinct.\n\n\nIf you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide, authoritarian politicians argue, and in the main, voters agree. This logic presupposes, however, a reasonable and humane definition of 'wrong.' Practically everyone in a modern democratic society qualifies as a criminal and extremist by the standards of the sort of authoritarian regime that governed broad swathes of the globe in the 20th century.\n\n\nConsidering voters' (and customers') indifference to cooperation between law enforcement and data-rich financial service providers, the clear interest law enforcement has in cultivating such cooperation, and the regulatory hostility companies can expect if they resist, it's hardly surprising that PayPal should volunteer to enforce not just the law, but the preferences of government officials.\n\n\nPayPal's Acceptable Use Policy reads as if the company has been deputized by the authorities to enforce the laws they wish existed, as well as the ones that actually do. Item one under the heading 'Prohibited Activities' covers those that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Fair enough. There then follow a couple dozen other prohibited activities and yet more which require pre-approval.[50]\n\n\nThe obvious question is not addressed: why should PayPal restrict payments for legal goods and services – even 'items that are considered obscene?'\n\n\nOf course as a private company they're within their rights to do so. Customers can take their business elsewhere, the logic runs. But when most if not all financial services providers are similarly cowed into acting as freelance police, what is the alternative?\n\nIt's also worth interrogating the justification for companies behaving this way: they're private, true, but they're also some of the most heavily regulated firms in the private sector. Legislators and bureaucrats have long felt comfortable placing significant constraints on these companies' behavior. They could, I imagine, mandate that firms only censor transactions when actual laws are being violated, but they don't. \n\n\nThe result is a system that enables enforcement without legislation. A legal but obscene activity rubs law enforcement the wrong way. It is made known that payments related to such activities are risky for firms to process, so they don't. Replicated across the economy, this cycle creates de facto law without the need for democratic debate, legislative process or judicial scrutiny. These pseudo-laws can't be challenged or repealed – or even, usually, read. They are codified, if at all, through vague, sweeping references in terms of service agreements that can change at any time without notice.\n\n\nThe victims of this system are the small but growing class of 'debanked' people, who almost never find out why their bank – sometimes multiple banks – have severed ties with them. One day their cards stop working, they slog through their bank's customer service morass, and in the end they still have no idea why they've been deemed unworthy of an account.\n\n\nIn 2023, Naafeh Dhillon told the New York Times that his card was rejected one evening, and all Chase would tell him was that 'unexpected activity' had led to all of his accounts being closed.[51] 'I received no kind of warning or red flag,' Dhillon said. (Money sent by his Pakistani parents while he was in college was put forward as a potential culprit.)\n\n\nAnother Chase customer said he'd been unable to find out why he was dropped as a customer even after three years. \n\n\nA Synchrony customer told the paper that his funds had been frozen because – he was able to wring the reason from the bank – of an out-of-state attempt to log into his account. He made the attempt; he was traveling.\n\n\nRecall Alice, the hypothetical CBDC user I invented to illustrate the horror of being locked out of using one's national currency. Her money became unavailable one day, and she had no means of finding out why or reversing the decision. This sort of thing happens today, and appears to be happening more often.\n\n\nLawyers write expansive, moralizing terms of service that allow for the removal of any even remotely risky customer. Programmers and – to the extent AI is involved in the process, programs – translate these rules into automated systems that comb customer data for unexpected activity. Law enforcement, as I mentioned above, is only remotely interested in perhaps 4% of these alerts, but there's no question of letting the justice system sort out who's guilty of wrongdoing. Anyone the banks remotely suspect of anything, they simply kick out. Why take the risk?\n\nThere's no reason to expect CBDCs to operate differently. Who will build the compliance and risk management systems, after all, if not the people who built them for the banks? The only difference will be that when the central bank debanks people, they'll have no legal way to buy or sell anything.\nThe misinformation hunt\nA trend that, for the time being, is mostly unrelated to the financial sector provides a compelling reason to worry about the freedom to transact.\n\n\nThe past decade has seen the emergence of concerted activist efforts aimed at technology companies, originating from within their ranks as well as outside – from NGOs, universities, and the government. The details of the agenda – which is far from unified – change frequently, and often on a dime, but 'progressive' is the label activists generally use, and anyone passingly familiar with the political discourse knows more or less what that term indicates in a given moment.\n\n\nProgressive campaigns have focused most heavily on social media companies, where the goal is to ";

        string memory chapter5 = unicode"'deplatform' – that is, censor – unacceptable speech. Such speech includes racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry, with the crucial caveat that such labels are applied with shocking liberality: statements that would have occasioned no remark in the most progressive circles five or ten years ago frequently meet with shrieking denunciations today. Even inaction, declining to join in the denunciations or to express full-throated support for any number of mercurial shibboleths raises hackles. Silence, a common slogan has it, is violence.\n\nAnd if silence is violence, so of course is speech. And if dissent of either sort – spoken or tacit – is violence, it must be stopped by any means necessary, including real, physical violence. Once this line of thinking is pursued to its logical extreme, the usual brakes on censorship are easily dismissed as irrelevant, absurd – even, through a neat trick whereby the people stripping civil rights from their political enemies become the victims, fascist.\n\n\nPractically all of the speech the deplatformers would silence enjoys First Amendment protection. They bat away that objection. Much of the speech is factually accurate, and the deplatformers know that. No matter. If it doesn't conform to their ideological requirements, it is violence, or if that label doesn't fit, misinformation (also, disinformation).[52]\n\n\nIt has proven not just possible, but trivial, to censor disfavored voices with little to no justification beyond the invocation of that single word – misinformation – despite all the constitutional protections we might reasonably expect to stand in the way.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this expedient has proven popular not just with activists, but politicians, bureaucrats and law enforcement.\n\n\nThe Twitter Files, published in 2023 by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, have revealed that those engaged in the fight against bad speech often acknowledge privately that the posts they are censoring are factual (misinformation that's accurate has been given a special designation by censorship practitioners: malinformation).[53] They justify their inventions based on the risk that the facts could 'exacerbate distrust' in people and institutions they wish to defend.[54]\n\n\nPerhaps more important is who these misinformation fighters are. A few years ago, it was reasonable to assume that social media censorship was carried out by employees of the platforms due to pressure from, or sympathy with, activists.\n\n\nThe Twitter Files have exposed that assumption as hopelessly naïve. They have demonstrated active collaboration between employees of every major social media platform;[55] universities including Stanford and NYU; the National Conference on Citizenship, a federally chartered non-profit; and the Centers for Disease Control. Among the sources of funding for the partners involved in one such program – called the Virality Project, its focus was removing disfavored speech related to covid – are the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation.\n\n\nParticipants in this effort called for (and obtained) the creation of a 'Disinformation Governance Board' within the Department of Homeland Security. Calling this body a 'Ministry of Truth' or some other Orwellian label doesn't really enhance the impact: its real name is already apex-Orwellian.[56]\nOther revelations in the Twitter Files detail cooperation between Twitter employees and the FBI, as well as the White House. The company repeatedly acceded to requests from these entities to censor legal speech, including speech related to the 2020 presidential election.[57]\n\n\nAnother source of insight into government censorship of social media is Missouri v. Biden, a lawsuit brought by that state's attorney general, together with other plaintiffs, against the Biden administration. The discovery process in that suit has unearthed extensive evidence of First Amendment violations by the federal bureaucracy, much of it overlapping with the content of the Twitter files.[58]\n\n\nA few details add color to the overall picture: the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acted as a 'switchboard' for the censorship efforts of several executive departments, facilitating meetings that included 'DHS, FBI, U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Microsoft, and Verizon Media.'\n\nThe head of CISA, justifying the agency's role in coordinating censorship, argued that its mandate to protect infrastructure includes 'cognitive infrastructure' – that is, speech – and that 'it's really, really dangerous if people get to pick their own facts.' (The government, presumably, should be the sole arbiter of what is true.)\nThe plaintiffs note that the Census Bureau and the Treasury Department were also involved in flagging so-called misinformation to remove from social media sites. The Treasury's efforts, according to DHS documents, focused on 'public confidence' in the financial system. (I'm willing to bet that the contents of this essay constitute misinformation according to the standards of the Treasury's inquisitors.)\n\nThe Virality Project, mentioned above, 'provided strategic insights to government entities such as the OSG [Office of the Surgeon General], CDC, and the Department of Health and Human Services,' according to the complaint. The OSG in particular pressured Facebook and other social media companies to remove content related to covid.\n\n\nThe suit also details the government's coordination with platforms to remove election-related posts. Much of this was conducted through the Election Integrity Partnership, a Stanford-affiliated 'non-partisan coalition' that makes no mention, at least publicly, of having been set up by CISA.  (According to the complaint, this is 'simply another moniker' for the Virality Project; both refer to the same teams engaged in the same activities.)\n\n\nTo be clear: the executive branch, overseen by the president, created an organization to censor content related to presidential elections.\n\n\nElections being the main constitutional means of replacing the president and preventing him or her from staying on for life, I'd argue that people holding that office shouldn't be allowed to dictate what can and can't be said about elections. The fact that the effort was presented as purely academic and unaffiliated with the government is all the more galling.\n\n\nWhat could justify such antidemocratic behavior on the part of the government? They were putting a stop to violence of course. Except this violence, like so much of the 'violence' people are accused of these days, was simply to speech – or more precisely, hesitance to curtail others' speech. In July 2021, Biden publicly accused platforms of 'killing people' by allowing users to post alleged misinformation related to covid. Shortly thereafter the White House threatened to revisit legislation exempting platforms from legal liability for information users post there. Social media companies responded with a flurry of activity, reviewing or taking down posts and accounts the government had (privately) expressed distaste for.\n\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit also note that the government has moved beyond policing election- and covid-related posts, branching into 'climate change, 'gendered disinformation,' abortion and economic policy' as well as 'racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.'\n\n\nNo single thread runs through all of these topics, except current-year partisan politics, meaning in essence that the White House feels at liberty to order the removal of any content from any social media platform, so long as it disagrees with the political stance of the content.\n\n\nWe're presented with further evidence that misinformation – as a non-expert might describe it – is not the real concern. Facebook's parent company Meta (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) reassured the White House that it will target 'non-violative content, such as discussing the choice to vaccinate in terms of personal or civil liberties.' The factuality – forget the constitutionally protected status – of the content is not considered important; rather the acceptable line has been laid down (vaccines are safe and effective) and any challenge to that line, even if grounded in reality, must be removed.\n\n\nAnd just to emphasize something that's easy to miss in the foregoing: discussions of civil liberties were explicitly singled out for removal, itself a violation of civil liberties.\n\n\nA coordinated censorship campaign embracing social media companies, numerous government agencies, universities, law enforcement bodies, NGOs, the military, the White House, and miscellaneous activists already exists. Its participants are pleased with their success so far in curtailing constitutionally protected expression and plan to expand their efforts to any topic they deem politically salient, not stopping at elections themselves.\n\n\nIt would be appealing and no doubt rather simple for the censors to expand along another axis, from social media platforms into payment systems. As Taibbi noted in a statement delivered to Congress, 'ordinary Americans are not just being reported to Twitter for 'deamplification' or de-platforming, but to firms like PayPal [...] and crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.'[59]\n\n\nThe financial services sector is joining the misinformation crusade.\nJPMorgan Chase\nIgnoring Canada, banks don't yet condition their services on customers' holding acceptable views, at least to my knowledge.[60] There appears to have been a high-profile exception to the rule, however, and it could be a sign of things to come.\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase closed Kanye 'Ye' West's accounts after the artist made a string of explicitly antisemitic comments in the fall of 2022.[61] West's rhetoric – including a threat to go 'death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE' – escalated in the weeks following his bank's decision to cut ties, and before long he was publicly indulging in unambiguous praise for Hitler.\n\n\nIf there were ever speech that merited ejection from the financial system, I suppose this would be it. It is cartoonishly villainous to glorify one of history's greatest mass murderers and menace one of the communities he singled out for physical extermination. But accepting such a premise – that access to banking is subject to an ideological test of any sort – is fundamentally illiberal, and down the line it poses a greater threat to freedom and justice than some obviously unwell celebrity's embrace of Nazism.\n\n\nNow JPMorgan Chase, to my knowledge, is at perfect liberty, legally speaking, to end its relationship with Ye for this or any number of reasons. (Nor, to my knowledge, is there any proof that Ye's comments were the reason for the bank's decision.)\n\n\nBut as with PayPal, such decisions set a precedent that withholding the ability to transact is an effective and convenient means of social control. It's difficult to argue that the people running a private business – bank executives, say – should be compelled to provide services to someone they don't want as a customer. They should enjoy their own freedoms, after all.\n\n\nBut in the realm of finance and payments, the line between the state and private business breaks down before it's even drawn. Personnel move freely between Wall Street C-suites and the Treasury, along with any number of ministries of finance and financial regulatory bodies around the world. Just 15 years ago, American taxpayers bailed out the world's largest banks. A century before that, the country's richest bankers bailed out the American government.\n\n\nIt's far from surprising that when Canada ordered banks to summarily freeze the accounts of anti-lockdown protesters, the banks complied without a (public) word of complaint.\n\n\nNor is it surprising that PayPal acts as freelance private-sector law enforcement, doing its best to crack down on activities without asking the government to trouble itself with obtaining warrants or even making specific requests. Often enough, the activities aren't illegal, so law enforcement would have little hope of following the constitutionally prescribed procedure.\n\n\nReturning to Ye, though: should we shed a tear for the man in a ski mask extolling Hitler's contributions to civilization?[62] I don't plan to, but nor should we let contempt for this specific individual cloud our vision of the principles at stake. If only people who sank to such a level were targeted for financial exclusion, I doubt much practical damage would result. The world might even marginally improve.\n\n\nBut authoritarian overreach often targets the least sympathetic figures first, then, once it's gained momentum, moves towards the center. The 18th-century French revolutionaries began by defining an aristocrat as French society always had: a titular member of the nobility, recognized as such by clergy, commoners and other aristocrats alike. Many of the revolutionaries being aristocrats themselves, they weren't generally bent on killing the whole caste.\n\n\nWithin a few years, however, an 'aristocrat' could be anyone, commoner, noble or priest, unfortunate enough to fall foul of the mob. The virtuous revolutionary 'citizen' denouncing this aristocrat could be a member of the nobility who had renounced their title.[63] 'Aristocrat' was simply shorthand for a counterrevolutionary, a heretic. To be labeled one was to be one – no daylight shone between accusation and conviction – and to be one was to deserve death.\n\n\nWe might consider the case of Ye's interviewer in the ski mask incident, who practically pleaded with the artist to express at least some reservation regarding the Third Reich. Alex Jones is not generally known as a voice of reason. He is notorious for a years-long campaign meant to discredit and torment – of all people – the parents of victims of an elementary school shooting. \n\n\nUnsurprisingly then, when Jones was removed from all major internet platforms in 2018,[64] words of protest were few and far between. Who could regard the slippery slope of censorship with such dread that they'd defend the Sandy Hook truther?\n\n\nBut there were those who warned that the same fate would befall more and more people, for less and less heinous speech, and they were correct.[65] Today people are routinely removed from social platforms for posting 'misinformation.' As noted above, in many if not most cases, this speech is a matter of opinion, and in a sizable minority of cases, the 'misinformation' is factually correct, but considered somehow unseemly.\n\n\nDebates over the effectiveness of covid vaccines brought many such cases to light. As Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023:\n\n\n'take some of the stuff around covid earlier on in the pandemic, where there were real health implications, but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions, and unfortunately I think a lot of the kind of establishment on that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true.'[66]\n\n\nIt's not necessary, however, to make analogies to social media platforms to argue that financial deplatforming will hit a slippery slope. PayPal started sloping long ago, moving from policing sex work to policing speech.\nGuns, porn and abortion\nThe reasons behind PayPal or JPMorgan's actions can be guessed at, but the conversations that precipitated them are opaque and will probably stay that way. In some cases, though, financial deplatforming – or steps in that direction – are clearly the result of long and targeted activist campaigns.\n\n\nIn September 2022, Visa, Amex and Mastercard agreed to categorize gun sales differently from other 'general merchandise' purchases, the category under which such sales previously fell.\n\n\nThis added surveillance allows credit card companies to 'flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammunition are sold,' according to the Associated Press, which described the development as a 'significant win' for gun control advocates.[67]\n\n\nTo state the obvious, these activists aren't elected, so they can't be removed from office by voters. They aren't businesses, so they can't be pushed to change course by customers (though customers can and should punish the businesses that cave to such activists' demands).\nThese groups aren't directly accountable to ordinary people who need to make and receive payments, yet they're able to constrain these people's freedom to transact. They do so in order to make it more difficult to engage in legal activities that, in the activists' opinion, shouldn't be legal. Rather than accept the outcome of the democratic process and continue campaigning for stricter gun control, such groups enforce their preferred version of the law by lobbying for changes to the internal processes of financial platforms: legislation by other means.\n\n\nGiven the success of this technique, it's a matter of time before pressure groups subject a wider range of legal purchases to added scrutiny, without the hassle of winning elections and passing laws.\n\n\nThe editor of a Catholic news outlet spoke to Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in 2023, pressing him to consider whether the company was 'funding' the sexual exploitation of minors by processing users' payments to PornHub.[68]\n\n\nPro-choice activists have expressed justifiable concerns that opponents of abortion, another politically charged issue, are likely to seek out payments data in order to punish women who obtain the procedure. In 2022, after decades of campaigning on the issue and pushing for the nomination of Supreme Court justices who would overturn a 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, pro-life activists managed to ban it outright in several U.S. states.[69]\n\n\nWomen in these places are able to travel to other states to have the procedure (though in practice this isn't always feasible), and some advocates of the ban wish to prosecute those who do so. Payments data is a convenient way to gather evidence for such prosecutions.\n\n\nContacted by the New York Times, few payments providers would say what they would do in response to subpoenas from, say, Texas authorities seeking information on a woman's financial activity. Experts interviewed by the paper pointed out that courts could potentially order companies to turn the data over, as well as issuing gag orders to prevent them from alerting the woman alleged to have sought the abortion. She in turn could face jail time.[70]\n\n\nExplaining the precedents for such subpoenas, the Times wrote, 'Card issuers have grown used to requests for user data in terrorism, money-laundering and illegal-trafficking investigations.' The slope slippens.\nThe war on cash\nOf course, the authorities' and activists' ability to exploit payment rails as a chokepoint goes out the window if people simply pay cash. Unsurprisingly, then, the state is making efforts to curtail its use. It's common to hear politicians and policy wonks disparage the evils of 'dirty' paper money: dirty both in the literal sense, of germ-carrying bills, and more importantly in the figurative sense, of filthy lucre obtained illicitly.\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetization of large rupee notes in 2016 had the stated aim of flushing 'black money' out of the economy and moving towards a 'cashless society.'[71] The move caused immense disruption, forcing millions to line up outside of banks and ATMs (over a hundred people reportedly died in these lines). What it did not do was eliminate cash or leave the beneficiaries of crime and corruption stranded: essentially all demonetized notes were exchanged, so 99.3% of the dirty money blighting the Indian economy before demonetization continued to circulate afterwards.[72]\n\n\nIt's common to envision a near future in which cash has been eliminated entirely, but that's not to say it's an edgy or futuristic vision: people simply assume at some level that cash's time is limited. What use, outside of crime, could grubby paper notes have in an otherwise digital world?\n\n\nWhile it's possible that these assumptions are the natural product of the internet and smartphones, we can't be sure, because we can't ignore the effect of decades of legislation aimed at limiting the use of cash to small, everyday transactions.\n\n\nIn a piece published by Coin Center, University of Virginia Law School adjunct professor Abraham Sutherland details the history, effects and intention of the law's most powerful disincentive against the use of cash: section 6050I of the U.S. tax code, passed in 1984.[73]\n\n\nToday, Sutherland writes, due to this provision and its subsequent expansions and revisions, 'if you use large amounts of physical currency, there's something wrong with you, and it's probably that you're a criminal. It's such a legally fraught hassle that there's no other explanation.'\n\n\nIn 1970, in an effort to combat or be seen to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, banks were required to report cash transactions over $10,000, the equivalent of $65,000 today. In 1984, anyone performing commercial transactions was required to report similarly sized transactions by the passage of section 6050I. This allowed law enforcement to go after drug dealers for failure to report cash income, particularly after 1988, when violations were upgraded to felonies. (According to Sutherland, this is the only information reporting requirement carrying felony penalties.)\n\n\nThis change to tax law massively enhanced the state's capacity for financial surveillance. Whatever its intended purpose, this has become the law's most consequential effect, and the state has strengthened the statute in order to enhance this capacity further.\n\n\nThe reporting requirement has become a window, easily available to law enforcement of any description, into the financial lives of Americans. Any cash transaction of more-than-quotidian importance now must be shared with the tax authorities, who of course are normally barred from violating taxpayers' confidentiality. But the exception to this rule, passed by Congress in 1988, is Form 8300, the form the IRS requires anyone receiving $10,000 or more to file.\n\n\nThe Treasury can share your Form 8300 with employees of any federal agency or, as of 1996, any agency of any state or local – even foreign – government. Nor do these lax controls actually limit how widely cash transaction data can be shared: in 2001, Congress copy-pasted the text of 6050I into the Bank Secrecy Act, requiring the same information be shared with FinCEN, who can then treat it with even less regard for privacy than the IRS does.\n\n\nCash transaction reporting requirements militate against the logic of normal commerce. To accept, say, $20,000 in cash in exchange for some good or service requires a seller to verify their counterparty's government ID, obtain their Social Security number and date of birth, record their occupation, and describe the transaction. The seller then signs the form under penalty of perjury and mails it to the IRS in at most 15 days. Failure to meet this high bar of peer-to-peer surveillance on behalf of the government can result in a $25,000 fine or five years in prison.\n\n\nSutherland depicts what navigating it routinely might be like for a law-abiding business owner who wants to deal in cash. I suggest reading it; it's maddening. His point, though, is that such business owners are hypothetical. They do not and cannot exist, because at some point, they must give up on either cash or compliance. So cash is in practice an illegal medium of payment for businesses, unless they limit themselves to accepting it from customers in small amounts – the way a restaurant might – and immediately depositing it to a bank account.\n\n\nThis burdensome process encourages anyone not dealing in organs harvested from the living to simply use banks. But the process reveals something about the role of banks, at least from the government's perspective: the high-fidelity surveillance that merchants are required to perform on their counterparties is simply the level of surveillance the state can expect its compliant financial sect";

They become relevant pretty much immediately, so it's easiest to introduce them right away.\nCensorship resistance\nCensorship resistance refers to a technology's ability to, well, resist censorship. An encrypted messaging app is a good example: the app's creator – or the government, or whoever – is unable to censor your messages because they can't read them. All they see is encrypted gibberish, so they don't know what to block (or alter) and what to let through.\n\n\nNo messaging app, however, is fully censorship-proof. As a user, you can't be sure that the developers, perhaps at the behest of the state, haven't inserted a cryptographic 'back door' into the code, allowing them to read your messages and, by extension, censor them. Hence the circumscribed term: censorship-resistant.\n\n\nThe concept is straightforward enough when it comes to speech. It can sound a bit strange in reference to money, but the idea is the same: to censor a payment is to alter or interfere with it in some way – in practice, to block it. Financial services firms do this, often but not always because governments tell them to. A censorship-resistant payments technology is one that doesn't allow this to happen.\n\n\nCensorship resistance also implies resistance to forced payments: if someone can transfer your money on your behalf, without your permission (in a word, confiscate it), the relevant payments technology isn't censorship-resistant. This usage might seem a bit odd: when someone forces you to express an idea, we call that compelled speech, not censorship. But going forward I'll assume that the term encompasses this notion. Where more specificity is required, I'll refer to an asset as non-confiscatable.\n\n\nAn example of a censorship-resistant (and non-confiscatable) payments technology is bitcoin. No one can stop you from sending bitcoin, as long as you have the funds. It doesn't matter if you or your recipient is on any number of government lists; it doesn't matter if there's a law barring you or your recipient from using bitcoin; it doesn't matter if there's a law banning bitcoin. The transaction will process. Nor can anyone seize your funds, no matter what institution they work at or what courts have ordered them to do so.\n\n\nI should note that censorship resistance doesn't necessarily imply privacy. Encrypted chat apps happen to achieve censorship resistance through privacy, but a different solution could in principle allow anyone to read any message, without allowing for censorship.\n\n\nBitcoin prevents censorship of payments without providing strong privacy guarantees. All transactions are completely visible to the public. They're associated with apparently random addresses – like\n\nbc1qxhmdufsvnuaaaer4ynz88fspdsxq2h9e9cetdj\n\n– and not names, but that's a long way from true privacy. (Other cryptocurrency protocols provide stronger privacy guarantees, though exactly how strong is always controversial.)\nPermissionlessness\nPermissionlessness refers to the idea that anyone can participate in a network. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter are not permissionless (that is, they're permissioned): more or less anyone can sign up, but your account is available at the company's pleasure. Violate the terms of service, and they'll boot you off the platform. Anger the government somehow, and more often than not, they'll boot you off the platform on the government's behalf.\n\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, can't prevent anyone from participating in the network. No matter what institutions you've fallen afoul of, so long as you have the proper hardware and can access the internet, you are allowed to use bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto himself can't bar you from the network, nor can the largest military and economic powers on earth. You don't need permission.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization refers to the structure of a network. Facebook and Twitter are centralized. A company runs the network, and a CEO runs the company. Decisions made in the center determine what the network does, who can use it, and how.\n\n\nBitcoin is decentralized. No one is in charge. No one can mandate a change to the protocol or kick anyone off the network. No one can freeze or seize a user's funds or block a transaction.\n\n\nDecentralization is required to achieve permissionlessness, and vice-versa. For there to be rules around who can and can't participate, there must be someone to make and enforce them. Only centralized networks can be permissioned. Similarly, for a network to remain centralized, it must be permissioned. If anyone can join, the centralized hierarchy has no way of maintaining its position. To control a network, you must be able to gatekeep it.\n________________\n\n\nInitial thoughts\n\n\nImagine the horror of the first high priest to see [a] Gutenberg press and realize that the knowledge of how to build and use them was already distributed. I strive to inflict this specific type of horror.\n\n\nSuzuha\n\n\n\n\nA right is a strange thing. We think of rights as inviolable, but of course if that were true, we wouldn't need to call them rights in the first place.\n\n\nWe say that Americans enjoy a right to free speech, but censoring Americans isn't a cosmic impossibility like exceeding the speed of light. Far from it: censorship – of Americans and everyone else – is commonplace. When we invoke the right to free speech, we're saying we'll try exceedingly hard to prevent censorship. But insisting on such a right doesn't conjure fundamental forces in its defense; those forces don't exist.\n\n\nBy the same token, in order to have a right to it, the action in question needs to be vulnerable to outside interference. If it can't be trampled on, it isn't much of a right. What good would it do, for example, to codify a right to think? I don't mean freedom of expression – written, verbal or otherwise – but the freedom simply to hold an opinion in the secrecy and privacy of one's own head.\n\n\nCertainly there have been attempts to mold people's inner worlds: MKUltra and Pitești Prison come to mind. But to my knowledge, every such attempt has been a wasted effort.\n\n\nAnd granted, in certain places and times, people have been afraid to whisper the wrong thing even in their own homes. Hidden recording devices, even one's own children, might inform the authorities. Yet even in such hells, the regime can't stop people from thinking what they please. Propaganda, material inducements and threats of all sorts can help to bend the thoughts of a person or the populace as a whole. But at the end of the day, no one can reliably control the contents of an individual mind.\n\n\nSo why waste time, ink – or heaven forbid, blood – defending the right to think? Unsurprisingly, no one does. Nor would it make much sense to insist on a right to, say, teleport, since no one has yet figured out how to do so.\n\n\nIf people are capable of doing something no matter how exquisitely they're oppressed (like thinking), it's a capability. If they're incapable of doing it even in the most libertarian utopia (like teleporting), it's a fantasy. Rights lie in the finite but sizable space in between: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, speech, assembly, worship, bearing arms, suffrage and the rest are all both easy to perform and easy to impede.\n\n\nThe other quality a right must have is that society considers it permissible and ultimately, if not always intuitively, good. The rationale for letting an obviously guilty criminal walk free after the police conducted an illegal search, or letting a deranged bigot call for a campaign of terror and oppression, might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but the overall social order that results from maintaining these principles is preferable to the alternatives.\n\n\nSuch permissible and (in some sense) good activities don't come and go all that often. When they do, the shift is usually slow, grinding and intensely controversial. American society didn't recognize a right not to be enslaved for nearly a century. Today it does, but codifying the right required a bloody civil war, and enforcing it meaningfully took yet another century. The contest over the right to bear arms has ground on for decades, engendering deep resentment and division, with no rapprochement in sight.\n\n\nBut shifts in the culture aren't the only changes that can bring new activities into the range of conceivable rights. Shifts in technology can do so as well – and much faster. They don't take ordinary people's or governments' capabilities from zero to sixty at a stroke, and each new development has complex, simultaneous and often contradictory effects on all relevant actors' power relative to each other.[1] But they can change the basic calculus around what can or should be considered a fundamental liberty – not over the course of decades, but of years, even months.\n\n\nTake speech. The state (and church and others) have censored people's expression since the earliest days of human civilization. The first Chinese emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, sparing just one, exquisitely authoritarian, school of thought. Destroying books and murdering those who write them, of course, remains a popular expedient with governments to this day.\n\n\nIn recent centuries, however, the balance of power between would-be scholars and would-be book burners has shifted several times. The invention of the printing press represented a massive fillip to free expression and an equally massive handicap to those who would stifle it. Not only was producing books and pamphlets orders of magnitude cheaper, and hunting them down to burn them orders of magnitude more expensive, but the production of cheap, varied reading material in itself helped to promote mass literacy – in vernacular languages no less – which compounded the difficulties involved in controlling what the masses read.\n\n\nOn the other hand, governments were quick to discover the charms of mass-produced propaganda, not to mention a number of small-bore but effective tactics of suppression, like taxing paper and ink, or more recently, being a publication's biggest ad buyer. Nor was it any harder than it had ever been to organize networks of informants to root out heresy among their friends and neighbors.\n\n\nAfter the printing press, there followed trains, telegraphs, photography, telephones. These are taken for utter granted today, but singly and in combination, they altered perceptions of time, space and knowledge as – in all likelihood – nothing had since the advent of the written word.[2] From there, of course, the production of brain-kneading novelties only accelerated: radios, cars, planes, televisions, computers, cryptography, the internet, social media – each with its own intricate impact on the balance of power.\n\n\nToday powerful corporations run enormous social networks. (They're also rich, but not to the same degree they're powerful.) Governments control these to varying extents, ranging from almost totally, as China does WeChat, to imperfectly if at all, as the U.S. does Facebook and Twitter.[3] Regardless of the degree of government control, state surveillance of these platforms is pervasive. The platforms' own surveillance, incentivized by their ad-based business models, approaches perfection.\n\n\nOrdinary people would appear to be at a complete disadvantage in this context, and arguably they are, but at the same time they use these platforms to rapidly spin up campaigns to pressure and even topple governments, not to mention the damage they can inflict on businesses and – for some twisted reason – random individuals.\nMeanwhile, cryptography has allowed for the development of chat apps that thwart government surveillance, except of course when the government has exploited the app or been gifted a backdoor. (Also, by their own admission, states 'kill people based on metadata.'[4]) Similar technology may soon yield decentralized, private, censorship-resistant social networks, upsetting the power dynamic yet again.\n\n\nComplex as this situation is, it's still possible to apply the First Amendment to it and defend the right to free expression. It's become popular to argue otherwise, and these arguments are wrong. But I have to admit, today's panoply of censorship-resistant and -enabling gadgets, and the games of cat and mouse that emerge from it, are a far cry from the 18th century – when the world was surely complicated, but slower, smaller, and wholly analog.\n\n\nPhil Zimmerman, describing his rationale for creating the privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol PGP, addressed the impact of technological innovation on the freedom of speech:\n\n\n'Two hundred years ago, all conversations were private. If someone else was within earshot, you could just go out behind the barn and have your conversation there. No one could listen in without your knowledge. The right to a private conversation was a natural right, not just in a philosophical sense, but in a law-of-physics sense, given the technology of the time.'[5]\n\n\nToday, feeling confident that your conversation is private takes much more effort – to the extent it's achievable at all. But the philosophers and statesmen of the 18th century had no idea how far we would come – or fall – in the subsequent centuries. They formulated a right to free expression because Gutenberg's printing press, the opening salvo in this long technological contest, had shifted the balance of power and ignited debates about the limits, merits and evils of censorship.\n\n\nToday we should be having a similar debate. And we should be having it at a much faster pace than our Enlightenment forebears had theirs, because we don't have the luxury of generations in which to mull the matter over.\n\n\nTechnological change has taken transacting – sending and receiving money – from the realm of pure capability, something that's basically impossible to suppress, to that of a contested, imminently trammelable right. Where once it resembled free thought, today it's more like free speech.\n\n\nA state of near-total liberty, which only a few of us ever thought to notice, is rapidly slipping away. If we continue on our present trajectory, a basic freedom, a fundamentally good thing that's key to human flourishing, will disappear – quite possibly without serious debate.\n\n\nWe need to recognize, articulate and defend the right to transact.\n\n\nWithin recent memory – say 1993, that is 30 years before I write this sentence – nearly all small transactions were conducted in cash, an anonymous medium that provides no visibility to the state or anyone else who might be interested. Medium to large payments were made via check, a paper document that lets a bank or two in on the secret. (A sizable minority of checks were and are cleared through the Federal Reserve system, but if that process ever facilitated any sort of organized surveillance, I'm unaware of it.[6])\n\n\nCredit cards were common enough, but only a few decades old, and they were rarely used for small transactions. They were seen as a way for the at-least-moderately affluent to avoid carrying cash – cash being the default, and muggings for cash being a concern.\n\n\nNo one used payment apps. No one used any apps.\n\n\nThe beginnings of a financial surveillance apparatus did exist. Credit rating firms had long histories, predating the introduction of credit cards. And the first decades of the battle against organized crime and drug trafficking had begun to turn the tax authorities – with banks as their deputies – into watchdogs, interested as much in determining the sources of funds as the taxes owed on them.\n\n\nBy and large, however, people transacted freely. Unless you were subject to a law enforcement manhunt, your small, everyday purchases received practically zero. Cash's role as the medium of quotidian commerce was secure, unquestioned and undiscussed.\n\n\nSeveral factors doomed this state of transactional liberty, among which three stand out: the introduction of the consumer internet and the resulting digitization of the economy; the 9/11 terror attacks and the state's response, particularly the Patriot Act; and the explosion of consumer debt.\nBut I'm not really concerned with the history that brought us to this juncture. I only want to indicate how massive a shift has taken place.\n\n\nToday, a large and still-growing proportion of economic activity happens online. Even ostensibly in-person transactions rely increasingly on credit cards and payment apps. The degree and efficiency of surveillance over individuals' most granular economic activity is staggering, if difficult to characterize precisely, since it's conducted by states and private firms with no incentive to flaunt their spying. It could be that, at present, the whole enterprise is fragmented and barely useful as an analytical tool. I would believe this, if provided with evidence, but I'll default to not underestimating the adversary.\n\n\nIn any case, the present state of affairs is less important than the direction we're moving in. Near-complete datasets of billions of people's transactions exist alongside near-complete records of their travel – not just from X city to Y city on a certain date, but where they walk and drive, within a radius measured in feet, down to the second. Not forgetting internet browsing history, social media posting, even health metrics. It's simply a matter of putting the data to use.\n\n\nGiven past form and obvious incentives, we can expect governments and other powerful actors to harness this data in pursuit of near-complete visibility into people's most intimate lives, allowing for an unprecedented degree of control over individuals and groups. Judging by Edward Snowden's revelations, the U.S. government embarked on this journey some time ago,[7] but China's government appears to be even further along, and that regime may set the tone for the 21st century.\n\n\nThe topic of dragnet surveillance and the authoritarian social control it enables is huge and complex. Frankly I'm intimidated, so for the moment I'll concern myself with just one aspect of this larger picture: the ability to transact. Money. In an age of digital totalitarianism, practically every basic freedom is under threat, and I don't intend to try weaving together the freedom to travel, the ability to share and access information, the right to privacy, the right to due process, the right to vote, the right to bear arms, free expression, bodily autonomy and any number of other, intricately related, issues.\n\n\nTo the extent possible, I want to focus on the freedom to transact because it receives far less attention than anything else in the foregoing list, and because the associated technology is changing at rates only a small number of people truly understand.\n\n\nThe generation that heads the world's most powerful governments and financial institutions grew up before Gutenberg, as far as payments technology is concerned. Their assumptions were formed in an era of slow, analog, opaque processes that despots could make little use of. Intimidating and stifling people by interfering with their ability to make and receive payments rarely occurred to anyone, because it was almost never practical. People used paper money, gold, and credit. Records were physical and scattered, to the extent they existed outside of people's heads at all.\n\n\nOrwell, in his portrait of the bleakest totalitarian hell, doesn't think to introduce a means of exchange that tracks its users' actions and integrates them with data gleaned from the telescreens, or is only able to be spent in accordance with Big Brother's will. Perhaps Orwell wouldn't have used the idea if it had occurred to him, but almost certainly it didn't. How would it have? These capabilities are an extremely recent innovation.\n\n\nTo revisit the analogy with speech, there was a time when the printed word was regarded with unconcern, even by tyrants. Charlemagne was certainly no fan of free expression: he waged decades of highly destructive war against the Saxons for refusing to profess his religion. But he could not have been too worked up over books as a means of ideological cont";
        book.write(chapter1);
        string memory chapter2 = unicode"agion. According to the Annals of Lorsch, the emperor requested a copy of a history of the papacy from Pope Adrian I in 774. The book, which to be clear, had already been written, took a year to be hand-copied and transported over the Alps.\n\n\nThat was the velocity at which the two most powerful men in western Europe, the heirs of Peter the apostle and Caesar Augustus, could transmit information. Both would have been flummoxed by our anxiety over the instantaneous, global spread of heresy – sorry, misinformation – via light pulsing through massive cables at the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nTwelve centuries later, people's grasp of current and emerging technological capabilities is so unevenly distributed that we walk the earth simultaneously with Charlemagnes, Morses, Daguerres, Bells, Diffies and Berners-Lees.[8] Some of us, including the most powerful among us, don't consider how control of digital payment rails could pose a threat to anyone; others are launching us into a future so new and strange that vanishingly few people understand the risks and opportunities. Likely they themselves don't understand.\n\n\nWe won't have centuries to figure out the implications of credit cards – to say nothing of fully programmable money under centralized bureaucratic control in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\nCBDCs are one of the main concerns of this essay, and I'll go into borderline-excessive detail about them later on, but briefly: they are digital currency issued directly by central banks. Take Europe as an example. The European Central Bank issues the euro, and for the most part, euros are already digital; physical coins and bills make up a fraction of the total value of the currency. But the 'digital euro,' or whatever it ends up being called, will mark a sharp departure from how the euro works today.\n\n\nAs a CBDC, it will incorporate a complete record of every transaction in which it's used. This record will be available to bureaucrats and, by extension, politicians and law enforcement. Today, your bank knows when you spend euros deposited with them, or receive them to your account. But the central bank and the rest of the EU government don't know. They likely have some idea – perhaps more than you think – but their picture is necessarily incomplete.\n\n\nWith a CBDC, the state will receive a complete, real-time stream of all transaction data. Following the elimination of cash – a goal closely associated with the introduction of CBDCs – there will be no legal way to transact outside of this government panopticon.\n\n\nThe state will also be able to control CBDC transactions: freeze your account, confiscate your funds, prevent you from sending money to or receiving it from certain parties – whoever the state deems unfit. The rules governing how money works could in principle be arbitrarily complex and liable to change at any time.\n\n\nBanks can act this way today, and sometimes they do – often enough, when they do, it's at the behest of the state. But with a CBDC, the government will be able to intervene directly – no need to go through private-sector intermediaries who might make a fuss. Arbitrary limitations on the freedom to transact and summary seizures of funds might of course be illegal, but the question could quickly become academic. When violating the law at scale becomes so easy, the government might be hard to convince to do otherwise, especially when it can instantly revoke its critics' ability to buy food.\n\n\nFor the moment, CBDCs are more idea than reality. But world leaders are openly discussing their development and introduction. China is already testing a prototype at scale. The Bahamas has deployed one nationwide, the only country to do so – although almost no one uses it. In Europe and the U.S., bureaucratic and legislative wheels are turning. Journalists are being primed.\n\n\nThe same Turing completeness that lets you build a website that can look like anything and do anything with any data you give it, will determine the degree to which currency can be configured, manipulated and controlled. Drain the account of a single dissident; confiscate $200 from every resident of Los Angeles; give $50 to anyone who voted a certain way – hell, anyone born in July. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nOf course nothing is (entirely) new under the sun. Authorities have been seizing and doling out assets for millennia: the story of the Knights Templar comes to mind as a dramatic and well-known pre-modern example of punitive confiscation. But if Philip IV of France could seize the bodies and assets of 100-something individuals, he could never have dreamed of issuing an order that would render all the coinage in an entire district worthless instantly.\n\n\nThat's the sort of fearsome miracle central banks might be able to carry out in a few years: update a database row, tweak a configuration, perhaps for the really tough cases, write a few lines of code, et voilà.\n\n\nAs Matt Odell, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, has written, the preferred interface for this kind of thing is likely to be an AI chat bot, which 'seems ideal for weaponizing massive surveillance databases way more efficiently than current search tools.' (He provides an example input: 'close the bank accounts of anyone who went to the anti government protest in Paris last week.')[9]\n\n\nBy combining streams of near-perfect surveillance, the state will be able to view an individual's physical movements, reading material, expressions of opinion, social interactions and monetary transactions as a unified whole. They will have the ability to instantaneously throttle or halt the economic activity of individual dissidents and entire social groups.\n\n\nIn the U.S., this outcome still lies somewhere over the horizon – how far is anyone's guess – and may even be avoided to some appreciable degree. In China, this reality has already begun to take shape.\n\n\nBeginning in April 2022, banks in the central Chinese province of Henan suspended cash withdrawals, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without access to their savings. The following month, hundreds of protesters traveled to Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, to demand the return of their money. When they planned to repeat the protest that June, however, many found themselves unable to leave their homes. The government had falsely diagnosed them with covid, flipping the health codes on the would-be protesters' phones to red. Under the draconian lockdown regime in place in China at that time, this was the equivalent of placing them under house arrest.[10]\n\n\nThe mechanism for social control in this case wasn't a CBDC – though China has been actively testing one in a growing number of provinces since 2020 – but it's easy enough to see the template behind these actions: centralized institutions (according to protesters, the banks are connected to political power brokers) seize people's assets, then prevent their victims from causing trouble by restricting their movements.\n\n\nBoth steps could be accomplished more efficiently using a CBDC: you can go protest in Zhengzhou, no problem, as long as you don't need to pay for transportation or fuel or food.\n\n\nFortunately, even as new technologies are enabling sinister authoritarianism, they are providing a means of escape. A parallel financial system built on cryptocurrency protocols has begun to take shape. This system has defied censorship or control by even the most determined and powerful global actors, and it's only becoming stronger and more resilient. (Its relationship to surveillance is complex, simplifying it at times, frustrating at others, but it effectively thwarts attempts at censorship.)\n\n\nProponents of the emerging crypto financial system often stress the minimization of trust: you don't control your crypto assets when a custodian has promised to hold them for you, or the courts have vowed to protect them, or the architects of the system have assured you its source code is safe and benign. You control your crypto assets when, and only when, you're the only one in control of the cryptographic keys, and the software encoding the system is open for you and all the world to scrutinize, tinker with and attack.\n\n\nThis is all perfectly true. And it goes some way towards accomplishing a laudable goal: obviating the whole discussion of 'rights,' at least as far as money is concerned. Bankers, payment processors, politicians and bureaucrats will respect the sanctity of your rights, right up until the moment they don't. Ethereum, bitcoin and their ilk are machines. You can see the code they run on, and those are the rules. They are indifferent to moral panics, social engineering, dot plots and managerial maneuvering.\n\n\nThis description does not, of course, apply equally well to all cryptocurrencies, some of which are very much centralized. At the time of writing, though, protocols such as bitcoin and ethereum are credibly decentralized, neutral and censorship-resistant. Nor am I aware of a technology outside of cryptocurrency that accomplishes anything comparable.\n\n\nIf the technology exists to escape the slide into financial tyranny, then why write a polemic about the right to transact? Will invoking a slogan protect our freedoms better than building decentralized, censorship-resistant systems? Wouldn't my time be better spent implementing the latest research into, say, zero-knowledge proofs – or the nearest thing my skill set allows?\n\n\nDon't cypherpunks write code?[11]\n\n\nMy answer is that our technological arsenal is critical, but not enough on its own. We need social consensus on what the technology means and what ends it serves. Do elliptic curves care about our ideologies? Of course not. The shapes rotate on, elegant, indifferent, unstoppable. E pur si muove. But without an ideological, moral, political – in short, a memetic – component, we can't make the case for adopting these technologies at scale. We can't develop arguments to prevent them from being defanged, backdoored, persecuted, or regulated into docility.\n\n\nWe need an intellectual arsenal to fight the already-very-much-underway backlash by that sadly large cohort in every place and time that wants to be coerced.\n\n\nNor can even the most sublimely implemented blockchain hold the violence of the state at bay, at least not directly: they may never be able to block or reverse a single transaction, but they can send men with guns to your house and put you in a cage. They may even take your private keys in the process. A pervasive cultural sense that people have a right to transact helps reduce that risk. A law or constitutional amendment would be even better – while clearly recognizing that all of it would be meaningless absent the power of the protocols themselves.\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, if you're reading this and think your time is better spent building freedom-preserving cryptography – I agree. Put this down and get back to it. Please hurry.\n\n\nOnly a handful of people are likely to be raising that objection, though, and in any case, they're already sold on the arguments I care about. We share a fundamental commitment to the freedom to transact, they're just purists. (Or as they might put it, I'm a tourist.)\n\n\nOther, much larger groups of people will have different and more fundamental hesitations about the wisdom or usefulness of this 'right to transact.' In the rest of this essay, I'll attempt to address those as best I can. For now, here's the short version.\n\n\nFirst: the freedom to transact we enjoyed until very recently was a good thing. It deserves to be regarded as a fundamental right, on par with the freedom of speech. Doing so involves significant risks and tradeoffs, but the downsides are much exaggerated. Due process has downsides. Protections against unreasonable search and seizure have downsides. We accept them for good reason, and those who would erode these rights are usually concerned not so much with safety, fairness, justice and the rest, as they are with imposing control over a cowed populace. This is the case with the right to transact.\n\n\nSecond: this right, so long enjoyed in practice without being discussed, because it seemed natural and was hardly ever threatened, is now rapidly disappearing. This is a harmful process that should be stopped and reversed as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Or if not, if abolishing the freedom to transact is somehow a good thing, the people who think so need to make their case. Taking away a freedom that has so thoroughly pervaded our lives should involve the democratic process. It shouldn't occur in silence as the result of a thousand small decisions by private firms and bureaucrats. Pass a law. (Or better yet, come and take it.)\n\n\nThird: we currently possess technologies that, properly deployed, maintained and adopted, will substantially restore and protect the right to transact. We should reject attempts, however well-intentioned, to muddy the waters about what cryptocurrency represents at this moment in history. Its drawbacks and growing pains, while real, are more than acceptable in the face of the alternative, which is to embrace our slide into perfect surveillance and financial unfreedom. There is no third option that pleases crypto's critics while preserving even a modicum of the freedom previous generations enjoyed.\n\n\nStarting with number one then:\n________________\nThe freedom to transact is a good thing\n\n\nFor if Power without laws, can make laws and change the Fundamentall laws of the Kingdome, I know not what subject in England can be secure of his life, or of any thing which he doth call his own.\n\n\nCharles I\n\n\n\n\nTrying to justify a basic moral truth in abstract terms is usually a bad idea. If personal experience, knowledge of history and a general moral framework can't convince you one way or the other on questions like the freedom of worship or the right to due process, a soup of latinate nouns isn't likely to do the trick.\n\n\nAppeals to empathy may have a better chance of success, but empathy won't spontaneously arise in someone who's lacked it so far. And those who enjoy the good graces of the powers that be – through whatever combination of luck, enthusiasm, docility and compromise – often struggle to imagine themselves at the wrong end of arbitrary power.\n\n\nIt's tempting, and perhaps wise, to simply reject the whole exercise. If people truly have a right to transact, say so and leave it at that. Agents and fans of state and corporate power will deny any such right exists, however sublime the arguments in its favor. And people who value individual liberty are likely to agree with the basic position, even if the arguments are nonsense.\nThe authors of the Declaration of Independence didn't tie themselves in philosophical knots over the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They called the whole package 'self-evident' – along with human equality, for good measure – and they moved on.\n\n\nSadly, I doubt I can get away with the kind of terse moral clarity the American founders used. The fact is that not everyone holds this truth – that all people should be free to transact – to be self-evident. Most people, through no fault of their own, don't know what it would even refer to. What do you mean, who's stopping you?\n\n\nAs I've argued, the issue hasn't been salient until now, given the capabilities at would-be oppressors' disposal. Cash, the quintessential means of free transaction, remains a fact of daily life. We don't learn in school about some bygone decade's fight to transact freely, because the clash is only beginning – assuming we put up any fight to speak of. The battle lines are mostly alien to the public forum, combining with more familiar fronts in the culture war to form an uncompelling scalene triangle. Accepting or hastening the end of the freedom to transact is, for the moment, the bipartisan default.[12]\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Declaration of Independence didn't instantly end the struggle for basic liberties through the power of stirring language alone. Seven more years of war were necessary to decide this 'self-evident' question.\nThe right to transact as prerequisite\nFor the most straightforward and perhaps the most convincing argument I've heard regarding the right to transact, I'm indebted to 6529. I prefer to phrase it in my own words, so please don't attribute any shortcomings in my formulation to him (?), but he deserves the credit for showing me how simple the question really is: once we're denied the right to transact, we're denied every other right by extension.[13]\n\n\nThe ability to buy and sell things is a prerequisite to rights we already regard as inalienable. Take the right to life: it becomes all but impossible to live when you can't buy food, pay for shelter, or sell goods and labor to obtain money in the first place.\n\n\nA person who isn't allowed to buy or rent a car, or pay for a bus or train ticket, can hardly be said to enjoy liberty. Someone barred from basic participation in the economy can't pursue happiness.\n\n\nRemove the right to transact, and you've in practice trampled on any other civil, human and constitutional right we might care to mention.\n\n\nTo be completely clear, I'm not describing a situation of poverty, though that would likely be the ultimate result of the situation I am describing: one in which a person has money, or easily could, but they've been cut off from the system that makes it usable. Their deposits are frozen; their means of sending a payment is disabled; their means of receiving a payment is disabled.\n\n\nI have in mind a situation in which money cannot meaningfully be owned except by its state or private-sector administrators, who grant access to it contingent on whatever criteria they choose.\n\n\nBut what would such a world – such a money – look like? That's hard to say definitively, since it's never existed.\nA thought experiment\nIt isn't difficult to imagine, though. Here's a situation that, given the trajectory of technological and political developments, an ordinary person could plausibly experience before the decade is out: without having been charged with any crime, much less convicted of one, she wakes up to find that her digital wallet no longer works.\n\n\nLet's call her Alice.\n\n\nAlice walks into a cafe in the morning, orders a coffee, and taps her phone to pay for it. A peevish vibration alerts her that the transaction has failed. The Federal Reserve wallet app (let's say she's American), containing all of her dollar deposits in the form of a central bank digital currency, has rejected the purchase. She doesn't carry physical cash, because the government no longer issues it or recognizes it as legal tender.\n\n\nShe tries again, and the phone buzzes again. An error message on her screen informs her, unhelpfully, that something has gone wrong. She drives to a gas station and the error repeats. She can no longer travel. The grocery store won't take her payment either. A week later, the lights and heat go out. She can't pay her utility bills, or for that matter her rent.\n\n\nIf Alice works outside the home, and she can't get to her workplace reliably or at all, she'll lose her job and income. If she works from home, her ability to do so will depend on her having, at a minimum, basic shelter and utilities, and realistically much more than that: the equipment and services she needs to perform her work, even if that's just a laptop with an internet connection.\n\n\nOf course, the question of having what she needs to work might be irrelevant. Let's assume the account freeze hasn't simply prevented Alice from sending money – it's blocked her from receiving it. Even if she could work, she couldn't be paid.\n\n\nA credit card might help fend off the crisis for a few weeks or months, but if her digital dollar wallet remains locked, those bills will go unpaid, and that means of transacting will disappear as well. Nor does it seem likely that the card company would extend credit to someone whose central bank wallet had been shut off.\n\n\nAlice may have no method of finding out why she can't send or receive money. Huge, unaccountable institutions often decline to explain their motives. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that some explanation is provided.\n\n\nWhat could a satisfactory explanation be? What could justify this treatment?\n\n\nWhat could Alice have done – or failed to do – such that a constitutional democracy, subject to the rule of law, could countenance this response? Perhaps an especially vicious crime would, set in the scales of justice, balance out this fate more or less. But if Alice were a dangerous criminal, a menace to those around her, the solution wouldn't be to leave her out on the street, free to commit further acts of depraved violence. It would be to incarcerate her.\n\n\nSimply removing Alice's ability to obtain the necessities of life doesn't protect her neighbors. If anything it endangers them more: now she's not just a violent criminal, but a violent criminal deprived of all legal means of getting food and shelter. Nor does the punishment serve to reform or rehabilitate her. There are those who see prison as a barbaric institution to be abolished entirely; somehow I doubt they'd see removal from the economy as a viable alternative.\n\n\nIf Alice were a fraudster, a Madoff who'd committed financial crimes, this punishment might have a certain karmic ring to it. But it would be unconstitutional: the Eighth Amendment bars the justice system from imposing ironic sentences like folktale genies.\n\n\nIt's difficult to imagine treating someone this way for any reason, which seems to me a serviceable, if inside-out, definition of a right. We would not, for any reason, forbid someone to espouse a particular faith; in other words, we recognize the freedom of worship. We would not strip someone of the ability to use their nation's currency; in other words, we recognize the freedom to transact.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the right to transact doesn't make any given good or service automatically legal to buy or sell. Illegal items and activities would remain illegal. You are not, nor should you be, allowed to possess a collection of potent nerve agents. But we might add, without any contradiction, that it would be absurd to revoke your permission to use money, based on the assumption – however well-founded – that you would use it to buy potent nerve agents.\nTerms of service\nSuch an approach would of course be expedient for law enforcement and financial institutions, but their convenience shouldn't define what a liberal society does and doesn't allow. We can't accept preemptive asset freezing any more than we would accept a person having their right to free speech preemptively revoked, based on the idea – again, however well-founded – that their ravings might give rise to something illegal.\n\n\nAnd yet making the lives of cops and compliance officers easy is exactly what lies at the root, not just of Alice's hypothetical hell, but of a growing number of real people's (more on that later).\n\n\nThere are clear precedents for treating people in similar ways. Social media companies routinely remove content and ban users who engage in perfectly legal, but ugly or inconvenient, speech. Unacceptable as the platforms' behavior may be according to any good-faith interpretation of democratic, constitutional principles, such expedients became the norm in less than a decade.[14] It is convenient for powerful people and wholly satisfactory to powerful political coalitions. Unsurprisingly, no one has stopped it.\n\n\nReturning to the question of what Alice might have done to deserve her fate, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that she somehow violated the Fed's terms of service. We posited that she wasn't charged with a crime. If she had been – or rather, if she'd been convicted – she might justly suffer unpleasant consequences, though summary removal from the economy would be a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.\n\n\nThe idea that a court would let a convicted criminal remain physically free, but strip them of the ability legally to obtain basic necessities, is – thankfully – unrealistic. What's depressingly plausible is this scenario: aided by constant surveillance, a bureaucrat ";

It expels the person responsible without providing any form of recourse or due process: Your account has been flagged for unusual activity. Please contact our support team to resolve this issue. The support team is an AI chat bot that might as well be a stone wall, and there's no way to speak to a human being.\n\n\nWelcome to the black market.\n\n\nThe offenses for which a person might be removed from the payments infrastructure are unlikely to have been clearly enumerated by a democratically elected legislature. More likely they'll be written by employees of a federal agency, or the Federal Reserve, or a private-sector firm to which CBDC development has been contracted out. These rules almost certainly won't be limited in scope or subject to more than symbolic oversight. Rather, they're likely to include the sort of any other unacceptable conduct, as solely determined by us language familiar to the dozen or so people who have actually read a terms of service agreement all the way through.\nEnds and means\nIn some ways the preceding hypothetical is a bit extreme: most likely, relatively few individuals would be totally removed from a CBDC economy. Remove too many people entirely, and the black market will outstrip the approved one.\n\n\nRather than focus too much on the unfortunate few who would be entirely excommunicated, let's consider the far greater numbers who would be subject to subtler infringements of their freedom.\n\n\nHaving lacked the option to instantaneously fine-tune entire populations' access to money, it's hard to say exactly what policymakers would choose to do with this ability. There are no straightforward precedents. Still, it's worth speculating. Sooner or later we'll arrive at a juncture where politicians and bureaucrats do enjoy these capabilities, in some countries if not most, so we should devote some thought to what they might do with them.\n\n\nPresumably, at least in the beginning, they would pursue benign-sounding goals. We can imagine a few possibilities: encouraging healthy, sustainable eating; discouraging drug and alcohol abuse; boosting favored industries; giving historically marginalized groups a leg up; and keeping inflation and unemployment in check.\n\n\nYou may find that your spending on fresh produce is subsidized with little discounts to encourage a healthy diet. Same, perhaps, for plant-based meat substitutes. You might find, by contrast, that the five pounds of steak you wanted to buy for a birthday barbecue trigger a penalty, or even rejection: three pounds of red meat is the most you can purchase in a week. Perhaps your third trip to the bar or casino this week similarly fails. Or maybe your phone's accelerometer, GPS and other sensors come to the conclusion that you've been indulging in cocaine again, and it's time to throttle your spending for 36 hours so you can rethink your choices.\n\n\nPerhaps, in line with the Fed's attempts to lower unemployment and raise consistently below-target inflation (those were the days), a negative interest rate has been put in place, with the result that your deposits automatically fall by 0.5% per year.\n\n\nPerhaps, in order to reduce wealth inequality or discourage premature retirement, each dollar saved comes with a 20-year expiration date. \n\n\nOr perhaps a recent 'police-involved shooting' has led to protests in your part of town. Wallets in the area might be frozen until the crowds disperse – or even, to teach the querulous districts a lesson, a bit longer.\n\n\nIt's easy to imagine that no one will be entirely free to spend their money on legal goods and services as they please. All money will to some degree resemble food stamps: not a uniform, neutral and universal means of exchange, but a form of coupon subject to complex, changing and humiliating rules. Your purchasing power will be a function of the government's opinion of your decision-making abilities.\n\n\nUnlike food stamps, though, the restrictions need not apply to all recipients in the same way. Favored people will obtain favored objects more easily. Disfavored people will need to justify their choices, and disfavored objects of desire will become harder to obtain. Nothing in principle would stop such restrictions from taking the minutest individual circumstances into account: limits to your freedom to transact could be targeted with the precision of social media ads.\n\n\nThis is of course far too much power for anyone to have over the medium of exchange. The state cannot be allowed to intrude into every economic event, however minute, and not just as a spectator, but as the final arbiter of that transaction's acceptability.\n\n\nBefore moving on, I should stress that the above – even if it sounds awful – is a relatively optimistic scenario. It's a vision of the sort of bumbling, manageably corrupt, blinkered, corporatized, residually competent state typical of Western democracies circa 2023.\n\n\nBut there's no guarantee this situation persists even in the medium term. When a government veers sharply towards totalitarianism of whatever sort – communist, fascist, theocratic or in thrall to some fresh horror – it will enjoy the same fearsome control over payment systems as its on-the-whole democratic predecessor.\n\n\nThe ability to interfere with people's freedom to transact, once obtained, will outlast any particular government or form of government. Even if liberal democracy writ large enjoys centuries of continued vigor, a few countries will fall into totalitarianism along the way. Anyone living in a constitutional democracy should hesitate to build a CBDC or any similar system – certainly for their own sakes, but also for their children's.\n\n\nAnd in any case, such a level of centralized control in itself can't help but alter the basic character of the state. The capabilities of centralized programmable currencies will change constitutional democracy in significant and unpredictable ways, assuming they don't simply destroy it.\nWorse-case scenarios \nLet's imagine this system in the hands of a more straightforwardly ruthless regime. First, we should acknowledge that the system can be combined with hyper-accurate personal data of any sort: location data, browsing history, social media interactions, calls, texts, medical records, 'smart home' audio recordings, footage from security cameras (equipped with facial recognition), genetic data. All of this data can then be synthesized, organized and interpreted with the aid of artificial intelligence.\n\n\nAny government will eventually attempt to bring these methods of surveillance and analysis together into a more or less coherent apparatus. (Success is of course not guaranteed.) But the more straightforwardly power-hungry the state, the more quickly it will do so, and the less compunction it will have about, say, barring you from renting in a certain neighborhood due to the contents of your genome.\n\n\nDictators have long seized and doled out assets to win support or punish dissent. Equipped with full visibility into and control over transactions, they'll be able to do so with ease and precision. Disfavored groups – be they long-oppressed or former oppressors – could find themselves, if not simply robbed, then fleeced by inflated prices, or barred from obtaining scarce or desirable goods. The malicious logic of the Jim Crow-era shop owner who quotes one price for a white customer and another, higher one for a black customer could be built into the means of exchange itself.\n\n\nThose marginalized by the state could be hemmed into ghettos by geographically delineated permissions to shop, rent, work, or get transportation. Even merchants and landlords who opposed such controls couldn't easily protest them: the transactions would simply fail. Nor does the control of movement need to be purely spatial: leaders will be able to impose targeted lockdowns and curfews using the same means (recall the protesting depositors' surprise covid diagnoses in Henan).\n\n\nAnd these restrictions could be arbitrarily fine-tuned. Using location data, the screws could be tightened on anyone who's frequented a particular house of worship – or failed to. The criteria for punishment could be anything: having purchased a certain book, downloaded a certain file, visited a certain clinic, immigrated from a certain country, attempted to emigrate to another one, purchased from a certain business – or better yet, failed to. Or it could be a matter of having spoken a bit too freely in the presence of a smartphone microphone.\n\n\nI'm hardly the first one to raise these concerns. Maya Zehavi, an Israeli founder and investor in the cryptocurrency industry, has written: 'The number one reason I'm against CBDC in the surveillance mode BIS is promoting - how my extended family managed to hide away money & gold to survive the ww2 in relative safety. The rising fascism across the world alongside brewing antisemitism means we need to support a web […] For the worst case scenario.'[15]\n\n\nIn order to avoid becoming a tool of repression, money needs to remain neutral and portable. Enforcing the law is all well and good. But what if it's against the law to be Jewish, Tutsi, Rohingya, Uyghur? Have modern states demonstrated the wisdom and humanity we'd expect of institutions aspiring to build CBDCs? \n\n\nIt's also important to stress that official neglect can be as harmful as official malice. Barring unprecedented feats of conscientiousness and efficiency on the part of the state, there will be many whose remoteness, poverty, lack of education, or mental or physical impairment will prevent them from gaining access to a CBDC in the first place. The state will have no particular quarrel with them – only a measure of contempt, when and if it remembers them. The result will be the same.\n\n\nTo add insult to injury, central bankers almost always cite 'financial inclusion' (access to a bank account and a means of payment) as a reason to adopt CBDCs.[16] It's true enough in principle that central banks could offer CBDC access to people who can't open accounts at private-sector banks.\n\n\nBut in what world is making the use of currency – in any form – contingent on clearing bureaucratic hurdles like identity verification an improvement on the status quo? As I'll discuss later on, central banks also tout the ability to surveil CBDC usage and root out money laundering and illicit activity as an advantage. To do so, by their own admission, they'd need to tie CBDC accounts to verified, government-issued IDs – exactly what many of today's financially excluded lack.\nMonopoly money\nNor will those excluded from the CBDC system, intentionally or not, be able to fall back on legacy forms of payment like cash – at least not legally. For the scheme to even plausibly accomplish policy goals, governments will need to ban physical cash.[17]\n\n\nSubsidies, taxes, interest rates, stimulus payments, fines, geographic restrictions, curfews, caps on holdings, expiration dates, surveillance – if alternatives to central bank digital money are allowed to persist, all of these tools lose at least some of their efficacy. Witness European central bankers' anxiety about (metaphorical, mostly) mattresses stuffed with cash, which made passing negative interest rates through to ordinary savers more or less impossible. Bank of England (BOE) chief economist Andy Haldane floated a CBDC as a solution to this dilemma in a speech in 2015.[18]\n\n\nOf course, black market means of exchange will emerge. Loopholes and workarounds will be found within the system. Their exact forms will depend on the system's idiosyncrasies and vulnerabilities, but they'll certainly make use of combinations of flawed software, gaps in surveillance, and human laziness and corruption.\n\n\nThere will also be parallel systems: physical or digital tokens more or less emulating cash will almost certainly circulate, but using them will invite punishment. For an idea of how little sense of humor the state is likely to have regarding alternate payment systems, see its reaction to tax evasion.\nTax evasion, money laundering and crime\nSpeaking of which, I should address a whole range of criticisms of my position. Collected under one heading, we might say: censorship-resistant, permissionless – in a word 'free' – transactions are, in fact, bad.\n\n\nPeople who argue the above might cite any combination of the following ills, all of which the freedom to transact does or at least could in principle facilitate: tax evasion, money laundering, drug dealing, smuggling, bribery, gambling, prostitution, trade in weapons, predatory lending, extortion, and terrorist financing. Apologies if I've forgotten anything: human creativity, in financial wrongdoing as in all things, is boundless.\n\n\nSmall-scale tax evasion would certainly become more difficult under a CBDC regime. Cash transactions make underreporting not just easy but, I've heard, tempting. Governments have long managed to collect taxes without the aid of a financial panopticon, though given the tenacity of tax evasion, a certain amount of frustration is understandable.\n\n\nModern states, more often than not, run grisly deficits, since they fail to tax at a rate anywhere near commensurate with their expenditures. (To do so would, at least in America, probably be impossible.) The incentive to build a system of total financial surveillance and control is clear, but I would argue that we simply can't consider tax evasion sufficient justification for the sort of regime that's being contemplated.\n\n\nAfter all, the ability to transact freely is nothing new: it's been the default for almost the entire time modern tax regimes have existed. Revenue collection has been imperfect as a result, but even so states have managed – at times – to keep debt within sustainable limits. When fiscal crises have occurred, the culprit has been war, unnecessary infrastructure projects, corruption, outright theft by the regime, or gambling by bankers far more often than it's been an especially tax-averse populace. Even where the tax take is abysmally low, the blame often lies with leaders who purchase political backing through low taxes and lax collection.\n\n\nEnding tax evasion, an unobjectionable goal in the abstract, would not prevent profligate states from spending their way into crisis. Nor would it merit the sacrifices in terms of freedom and human dignity the solution would demand. In any case, the most sophisticated and prolific tax avoiders would pursue technically legal means, the same as they do now. People who use cash to evade taxes hide thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in income; people who use offshore tax havens hide millions or tens of millions.\n\n\nMoney laundering is a similar story: in a perfect world, it would be unknown. A perfectly surveilled remote-control currency could conceivably put a stop to criminals' washing their proceeds through cash businesses, since cash wouldn't exist. But the stereotypical picture of money laundering through nail salons, strip clubs, pizza shops, or the classic laundromats – while I have no doubt it occurs – distorts the picture terribly.\n\n\nIndustrial-scale money laundering is performed not by these small, more or less seedy, cash-based businesses, but by huge multinational banks. These institutions are already subject to reams of regulation that require reporting and disclosure of 'suspicious' activity. They are as fully deputized to the financial surveillance apparatus as any sector could be, and yet the most cursory glance at their record in combating money laundering yields, well:\n\n• 'Wachovia pays $160 million to settle drug money probe' (2010)[19]\n\n\n• 'HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money-Laundering Charges' (2012)[20]\n\n\n• 'Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme' (2019)[21]\n\n\n• 'How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled' (2019)[22]\n\n\n• 'Westpac to pay record $1.3bn fine after money laundering and child exploitation investigation' (2020)[23]\n\n\n• 'Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal' (2020)[24]\n\n\n• 'FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning' (2020)[25]\n\n\n• 'Bank of America insider charged with money laundering for BEC scams' (2021)[26]\n\n\n• 'US families sue Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, accuse them of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan' (2021)[27]\n\n\n• 'Credit Suisse found guilty in cocaine cash laundering case' (2022)[28]\n\n\nIt could be argued that these institutions, while subject to extensive and expensive post-9/11 know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules, are simply ignoring them, and that imposing surveillance and control at the level of the individual transaction could force compliance.\n\n\nAs it turns out, though, the failure isn't the banks' alone. For the most part, they conduct the surveillance required by the American government, filing millions of 'suspicious activity reports' (SARs) with FinCEN, the division of the Treasury Department tasked with combating money laundering, every year. Each SAR filing sets in motion an intricate protocol, as BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported in 2020, whereby the government ignores the reports and … the end.[29]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 survey by the Bank Policy Institute, less than 4% of SARs 'warranted follow-up inquiries from law enforcement.'[30]\n\n\nThis hollow ritual allows the banks to 'comply' with regulations by filing the proper forms and, when American regulators say nothing, continue to launder blood money. It allows American bureaucrats and politicians to claim to be fighting terrorists, drug dealers and mobsters. Occasionally, perhaps because a bank has failed to file the proper forms, the bureaucrats impose the sort of fine that banks can easily view as a cost of doing business. These 'enforcement actions' allow the bureaucracy to publish a press release and the politicians to rail against banks, whose campaign contributions they, for the most part, continue to accept.\nWhat the ritual does not accomplish is stopping Mexican or Colombian drug cartels, or kleptocrats in Soviet successor states, or jihadist terrorists, or the operators of Ponzi schemes from cleaning their money. The most commonly cited estimate for the effectiveness of global anti-money laundering controls is in the range of 0.1-0.2% – one or two dollars in every thousand.[31] (This statistic also implies that other jurisdictions are no more effective than the U.S. in this regard.)\n\n\nWhat KYC/AML policies do accomplish is surveillance. FinCEN's 2020 report to Congress, in which it justifies its funding, repeatedly boasts that it has generated millions of reports of cash transactions, which are 'used to identify enforcement and investigative leads as well as strategic trends and patterns.'[32] Plainly, however, money laundering continues apace. The purpose of KYC/AML laws as they exist today is to enhance government surveillance of the financial system.\n\n\nSo it's no surprise that money laundering is being used to justify the creation of a system enabling total visibility into the entire field of economic activity: it's an old, successful playbook.\n\n\nProponents of CBDCs frequently claim that their introduction (and cash's elimination) would solve some of the financial system's most persistent and acute problems. In a paper cited by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution claim that 'the widespread use of CBDC and the obsolescence of paper currency would be helpful in discouraging tax evasion, money laundering, and other illegal activities.'[33]\n\n\nThe same claim is repeated in almost every favorable discussion of CBDCs, and it is almost certainly false. Particularly in the case of money laundering, policymakers have invoked the modern world's worst boogeymen to justify increasingly invasive scrutiny into individuals' finances. The system fails abjectly at accomplishing its stated goals,[34] but succeeds in gaining visibility into people's transactions – visibility that would be denied under normal constitutional procedures, whereby authorities who want to spy on people need to obtain warrants.\n\n\nIn an authoritarian tactic almost too cliché for parody, the state is demanding that we surrender basic freedoms in order to escape suspicion that we're drug dealers or terrorists.\nThe DMV\nSimilar logic has become so pervasive in the last couple of decades, it can be difficult to realize how strange and pernicious it really is.\n\n\nSo imagine the same way of thinking applied to driving: when you go to the DMV to renew your license, you're handed a tracking device you must attach to your car. Your movements – all of them – are recorded in a DMV database. Any time you drive more than 10 miles, the data from the journey is automatically reported to local, state and federal law enforcement (no need for them to request it, much less obtain a warrant).\n\n\nIf you travel more than 50 miles, or travel to a place you haven't been before, or make any stops in an area labeled 'suspicious' – there are many such areas, they change frequently, and you're responsible for knowing where they are – you need to file a Travel Justification Report and submit it to the DMV by fax. Repeated failure to do so could result in fines, suspension of your license, even jail time.\n\n\nIt's universally recognized that everyone who drives violates the rules daily. It's wildly impractical to comply with them all, and perhaps, given their complexity and overlap, actually impossible. As a result, you or anyone else could be punished at any time. You have little prospect of defending yourself: of course you've broken the rules, everyone has. The best way to protect yourself is to have friends at the DMV and police precinct.\n\n\nWhy are you being subjected to this bureaucratic lunacy? Because organized crime syndicates use roads to transport drugs. Because domestic extremists use roads to transport weapons and carry out terror attacks. Because human traffickers use roads to transport minors for sexual exploitation. What are you suggesting – that none of that matters?\nThe inevitable hack\nI've struggled to find the appropriate place to weave this next point into the argument, so I've left it as an inelegant close to this chapter. Then again, perhaps it makes sense as a jarring coda: in a way, that's what a hack is.\nEven if every worry I've expressed so far about CBDCs is misplaced, one bad outcome is all but inevitable: a substantial amount of the sensitive, valuable data collected through this new form of money will leak. The government will do its best to avoid a breach, and sooner or later it will fail.\n\n\nHackers will steal some or all of the transaction data, giving them potent leverage over people in positions of power, as well as countless ordinary people.\n\n\nLikely they'll be state-sponsored (hacking a government is generally not feasible for amateurs). There's precedent: beginning in 2014, Chinese government hackers obtained access to millions of personnel records held by the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management. The data was about as sensitive and valuable as any the state collects: it related to background checks conducted before granting security clearances to federal employees.[35] Such a haul is perfectly suited to facilitating the blackmail of U.S. officials by its most powerful adversary's intelligence agents, and still the government could not protect that information.\n\n\nStates should not be able to collect every detail of every payment conducted using their currency – because it's invasive, dangerous and unjust, but also because they can't be trusted to keep the data safe.\n\n\nNor is a spectacular attack by a rival superpower always necessary to create a breach. In 2018, the Tribune reported that access to Aadhaar, India's universal biometric identification scheme, was on sale to anyone who could pay. The paper's reporters were able to purchase not just the personal details of an individual or some chunk of individuals, but permission to search the entire database, containing highly sensitive information on over a billion people. The price was less than $10.[36]\nThe";

        string memory chapter4 = unicode" freedom to transact is disappearing\n\n\nAs of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.\n\n\nChrystia Freeland\n\n\n\n\nYou might see the previous chapter as overly anxious extrapolation from current trends, if not paranoid fantasy. I'm arguing that we've begun a slide into a state of profound unfreedom, in which the ability to obtain any good or service depends on the whims of the state, which – even if it's benevolent and wise for the moment (it's not) – could easily become uncaring, misguided or actively malicious.\n\n\nBut even if you accept that we could slide into such a hell, you probably wish I'd offer some sort of evidence that the slide has begun. A lot of things could happen.\n\nUnfortunately, there is ample evidence that business and government leaders intend to introduce fully programmable, remote-control currencies, and to use this technology to pursue policy goals that large constituencies – if not majorities – of the people affected would oppose if given a say. To put it more bluntly: CBDCs are an end run around democratic processes – and potentially, a highly effective one.\n\n\nAll the more so because, again unfortunately, the majority of the electorate in the average liberal democracy has little to no idea that such projects are being planned. CBDCs are no secret: I haven't smuggled sensitive documents out of some Washington sub-sub-basement. Central bankers have churned out discussion papers, white papers, proposals and plans related to CBDCs since around 2014,[37] but the audience for this literature is the sort of person who knows what 'FOMC' stands for, what the FOMC does, and most of its members by name. To the vast majority, 'CBDC' is just one more in a sea of wonkish acronyms.\n\n\nNot infrequently, the financial media will report on these central bank publications, but the coverage is for the most part perfunctory and little more than a rewording of central bank statements – sometimes with a nod to abstract Concerns added for balance.\n\n\nReuters' article on 'digital dollar' pilots announced in 2021 is a model of this sort of coverage: it presents CBDCs as a straightforward modernization project meant to 'improve payment systems' and 'boost financial inclusion'; the notes of caution – the need to protect 'privacy and freedom of commerce' – are provided by the NGO running the pilot and the central bank itself, not critics or even plausibly neutral observers.[38]\n\n\nI can only blame the media so much: interest in the topic simply isn't there. It's irrelevant to the culture wars that keep contemporary media in business (which is ironic, given how potent a weapon in those same culture wars CBDCs are likely to become).[39]\n\n\nAnd the source material, unsurprisingly, is sanitary fare. It takes a measure of skepticism and imagination to see how the dollar, but digital could empower states in ways they simply shouldn't be empowered. Perhaps, reporters, editors and readers alike could be forgiven for thinking, it takes a bit too much skepticism and imagination.\n\n\nBut read the literature closely, and central bankers protest too much, making promises to maintain privacy and neutrality that inspire less confidence every time they're repeated. And sometimes, they make no such promises, laying out plainly how closely they intend to watch individual consumers' most quotidian transactions, and how they intend to censor the ones they deem undesirable.\n\n\nNor would it be much comfort if central bankers sincerely desired to protect the freedom to transact. (They don't.) If the systems they implement don't enforce such protections at the protocol level – if human decision-making is the only safeguard – then sooner or later the decision-makers will abuse the powers these systems afford them. As Charlie Munger put it, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.\n\n\nFor the time being, though, CBDCs remain in the discussion and planning phases. But even in the absence of CBDCs, we're faced with a growing list of concrete examples in which public- and private-sector actors abandon the principle – never so much a principle as the plain fact of a cash-first world – that money is a neutral medium. Private firms have increasingly adopted the view that, even though it violates no law or regulation, a given transaction should be subject to their approval, based on criteria they're free to devise in secret and revise on the fly. Politicians, bureaucrats and activists have encouraged these abuses, pushing firms to limit or revoke their customers' freedom to transact on transparently ideological grounds.\n\n\nCBDCs themselves, in other words, are not the whole issue. They are likely to be developed and adopted, but even if they aren't, powerful actors already possess the willingness and capability to limit the freedom to transact. The following examples deserve our attention because they demonstrate that fact, but also because they demonstrate the motivations, tactics and justifications of the people behind them – people who, if they themselves don't eventually control a CBDC, might inspire those who do.\nCanada\nIn February 2022, in response to protests against covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates that saw truckers blockade economically important southern border crossings, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked a law granting the government sweeping emergency powers.[40] Under this expanded remit, the government froze the financial assets of protesters and required credit card companies and fundraising platforms to report activity related to the protests to anti-money laundering authorities.\n\n\nStanding alongside Trudeau, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Finance, announced these measures at a press conference (emphasis mine):\n\n\n'In invoking the Emergencies Act, we are announcing the following immediate actions. First, we are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use. These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n'The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms and some of the payment service providers they use are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Our banks and financial institutions are already obligated to report to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FINTRAC.\n\n\n'As of today, all crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use must register with FINTRAC, and they must report large and suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. This will help mitigate the risk that these platforms receive illicit funds, increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC, and make more information available to support investigations by law enforcement into these illegal blockades.\n'We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy. The government will also bring forward legislation to provide these authorities to FINTRAC on a permanent basis.\n\n\n'Second, the government is issuing an order with immediate effect under the Emergencies Act authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts.\n\n\n'Third, we are directing Canadian financial institutions to review their relationships with anyone involved in the illegal blockades and report to the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] or CSIS [Canadian Security Intelligence Service]. As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith.\n\n'Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades.\n\n\n'This is about following the money. This is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades. We are today serving notice: if your truck is being used in these illegal blockades your corporate accounts will be frozen. The insurance on your vehicle will be suspended. Send your semi-trailers home. The Canadian economy needs them to be doing legitimate work, not to be illegally making us all poorer.'[41]\n\n\nI hope you'll pardon the long quotation. I see Freeland's address as some of the most valuable primary source material related to the topic of this essay, both because it will be remembered as a turning point in the history of liberal democracies (hopefully in the direction of stronger protections for the right to transact), and because it perfectly captures the rhetoric and mentality of those who support increased surveillance of and control over payments.\n\n\nFreeland presented the government's gathering more data on its citizens' transactions as a good in itself ('increase the quantity and quality of intelligence received by FINTRAC'). She presented the new controls as an extension of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules. Since it's difficult to see how the protesters were laundering money (my understanding is that money launderers try to avoid drawing attention to themselves), that leaves two possibilities: the protesters were terrorists (she may in fact have meant to imply this) or, to my mind, the more likely conclusion – that these laws, with their distractingly villainous names, have little to do with terrorists or money laundering, and everything to do with dragnet surveillance.\n\n\nShe made no attempt to present these measures as consistent with liberal democratic values, such as the presumption of innocence, the right to free assembly, or limitations on the government's ability to conduct searches and seizures.\n\n\nInstead, she made eight references to 'illegal blockades.' They almost certainly were illegal: civil disobedience is illegal by definition. But beyond that, there are limits to what any state or society can tolerate from its protesters, and the truckers may indeed have exceeded those limits. It's not my place to say. What I want to stress is that no court heard evidence regarding these protests or ruled them illegal. The laws they were accused of violating weren't specified. In the space of five minutes, a government minister declared the protesters' actions illegal; unveiled a new, unprecedented punishment for their crimes; and deputized private sector firms to root out and punish the perpetrators.\n\n\nNor was it an idle threat. A week into the state of emergency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that they had frozen 219 financial products, as well as 3.8 million Canadian dollars held by a payment processor. (By that time, according to the government, the process of unfreezing assets had begun.)[42]\n\n\nCanada's actions have no antecedent that I'm aware of in modern liberal democracies, but even so they elicited muted criticism. Mainstream outlets, at least in the U.S., paid little attention to this innovation in the maintenance of public order: using information obtained through warrantless surveillance of the financial system to cut off protesters' access to credit cards and bank accounts.\n\n\nThe lack of any official condemnation from other Western governments suggests they might at least consider pursuing similar measures to break up protests against their own policies. To state the obvious, there is no guarantee that such weaponization of the financial system will be limited to left-of-center governments like Trudeau's, or its victims to those aligned with the political right. Once these tools become available to them, governments of any persuasion will gladly use them against protesters of any description.\n\n\nCanadians will almost certainly hesitate to attend protests critical of the government from now on, since they know that they can be arrested and denied the means to pay bail – indeed, pay for anything. Their right to free assembly has been effectively eliminated, without any need to pass a law or create a spectacle through physical confrontations. \n\n\nThe people of other ostensibly liberal democracies might soon experience the same chilling effect, to the extent they haven't already, having seen Canada's example.\nPayPal\nOften, financial services providers are happy to surveil and punish their customers for the sorts of infractions the Canadian authorities went after, but without any prompting from the government. (At least, any public prompting.)\n\n\nPayPal, a private payment processor, has for years enforced an idiosyncratic moral code based not on the laws of any jurisdiction it happens to operate in, but its own opaque Terms of Service regime.\nIn 2020, Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director at the non-profit crypto advocacy group Coin Center, compiled a list of examples in which PayPal barred users from its platform for engaging in perfectly legal activity: OnlyFans models were prohibited from selling nude photos on the platform; independent journalists tracking the spread of covid in prisons were kicked off when Twitter flagged them for spreading misinformation; a website publishing files for 3D printing guns (protected speech) and selling related merch was banned (their Twitter account is also suspended).[43]\n\n\nThe ACLU has criticized PayPal for barring sex workers.[44] The company was accused of stalling efforts to raise bail money for Black Lives Matter protesters.[45] It shut a user out for making payments related to Tor nodes he was hosting.[46] A Canadian news outlet's payment for an article about Syrian refugees was blocked – apparently for mentioning the word 'Syria.'[47] PayPal froze WikiLeaks' account in 2010.[48]\n\n\nRecently, the company went beyond keeping users' funds in limbo, and signaled its intention to actually seize money from users who fall afoul of its rules.\nIn October 2022 PayPal said it would levy steep fines for a range of activities, including speech the company deemed unacceptable.[49] The language of the updated 'Acceptable Use Policy,' which would have gone into force the following month, labeled the 'sending, posting, or publication of messages, content, or materials that meet certain criteria' as 'prohibited activities' that could result in fines of $2,500. Among these 'certain criteria' was content found to 'promote misinformation.'\n\n\nA company whose purpose – at least in its customers' eyes – is to process payments, has taken upon itself the duty to monitor its customers' speech, judge that speech's merits according to criteria known to no one outside the company (in all likelihood, never explicitly defined anywhere), and if the speech is found wanting, seize its customers' funds as punishment.\n\n\nTo be clear, the procedure envisioned in this document wasn't to freeze funds or bar access to the platform. PayPal would have gone beyond even Canada's emergency measures and permanently confiscated its customers' money. (The document was pulled from PayPal's website, and the company claimed the proposed change was an 'error.')\n\n\nIf a state took these actions, we would be rightly outraged, but hardly surprised. Monarchs, emperors, high priests, generals and the like have all too frequently done this sort of thing. In enforcing their vision of truth, they've used economic measures along with other, grislier tactics. One could name any number of examples from any number of places, going back as far as recorded history permits.\n\n\nFor a private company to adopt this attitude, though, is strange. Having your assets confiscated for heresy is one thing, if the Church or King is doing it. If a democracy is doing it, you might (but shouldn't) comfort yourself with the notion that at least the censorship is of, by and for the people. For an online payments service to act this way, though, is something else entirely. PayPal is not a democratically accountable institution. Nor does any sort of social contract exist that could conceivably give it the right to punish crimes of conscience.\n\n\nThe situation is just silly. PayPal isn't yet 30 years old. It has 'pal' in the name. For an institution of this type this to freelance as Ministry of Truth would be a farce, except that it's part of a definite trend: Facebook, Google and Twitter have taken it upon themselves to determine – according to inconsistent, flighty standards that make scant reference to constitutional principles – what may and may not be said.\nThird parties\nWhy should these companies be empowered to enforce a superset of the law? It seems law enforcement bodies themselves have provided some of the impetus.\n\n\nCops in constitutional democracies are in theory constrained by protections like the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure. But American authorities, at least, have a convenient way around these hurdles: once a person voluntarily provides a third party with information (the way PayPal's customers provide it with their payments data), constitutional strictures fall away. Law enforcement can simply ask the company for the data, with no need to seek a search warrant from a court.\n\n\nThe company could refuse, of course, in which case the authorities are back to petitioning judges through the normal procedure envisioned in the Bill of Rights. But from the perspective of a heavily regulated financial services company, how is it in your interest to stand up for your customers' rights? The politicians and regulators who can make or break your thin margins with a couple well-aimed laws or rules don't, with rare exceptions, care about your customers' privacy. They actively resent it, to the extent it makes catching criminals, terrorists and 'extremists' – a term that tends to cover the whole of the political opposition – more difficult.\n\n\nOne might expect voters to enforce a concern for constitutional protections by electing lawmakers who care about such protections: after all, these voters are almost all customers of one or more financial services firms. But by and large, the electorate doesn't care either. They too would like to catch criminals, terrorists and extremists, and this is a perfectly healthy instinct.\n\n\nIf you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide, authoritarian politicians argue, and in the main, voters agree. This logic presupposes, however, a reasonable and humane definition of 'wrong.' Practically everyone in a modern democratic society qualifies as a criminal and extremist by the standards of the sort of authoritarian regime that governed broad swathes of the globe in the 20th century.\n\n\nConsidering voters' (and customers') indifference to cooperation between law enforcement and data-rich financial service providers, the clear interest law enforcement has in cultivating such cooperation, and the regulatory hostility companies can expect if they resist, it's hardly surprising that PayPal should volunteer to enforce not just the law, but the preferences of government officials.\n\n\nPayPal's Acceptable Use Policy reads as if the company has been deputized by the authorities to enforce the laws they wish existed, as well as the ones that actually do. Item one under the heading 'Prohibited Activities' covers those that 'violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.' Fair enough. There then follow a couple dozen other prohibited activities and yet more which require pre-approval.[50]\n\n\nThe obvious question is not addressed: why should PayPal restrict payments for legal goods and services – even 'items that are considered obscene?'\n\n\nOf course as a private company they're within their rights to do so. Customers can take their business elsewhere, the logic runs. But when most if not all financial services providers are similarly cowed into acting as freelance police, what is the alternative?\n\nIt's also worth interrogating the justification for companies behaving this way: they're private, true, but they're also some of the most heavily regulated firms in the private sector. Legislators and bureaucrats have long felt comfortable placing significant constraints on these companies' behavior. They could, I imagine, mandate that firms only censor transactions when actual laws are being violated, but they don't. \n\n\nThe result is a system that enables enforcement without legislation. A legal but obscene activity rubs law enforcement the wrong way. It is made known that payments related to such activities are risky for firms to process, so they don't. Replicated across the economy, this cycle creates de facto law without the need for democratic debate, legislative process or judicial scrutiny. These pseudo-laws can't be challenged or repealed – or even, usually, read. They are codified, if at all, through vague, sweeping references in terms of service agreements that can change at any time without notice.\n\n\nThe victims of this system are the small but growing class of 'debanked' people, who almost never find out why their bank – sometimes multiple banks – have severed ties with them. One day their cards stop working, they slog through their bank's customer service morass, and in the end they still have no idea why they've been deemed unworthy of an account.\n\n\nIn 2023, Naafeh Dhillon told the New York Times that his card was rejected one evening, and all Chase would tell him was that 'unexpected activity' had led to all of his accounts being closed.[51] 'I received no kind of warning or red flag,' Dhillon said. (Money sent by his Pakistani parents while he was in college was put forward as a potential culprit.)\n\n\nAnother Chase customer said he'd been unable to find out why he was dropped as a customer even after three years. \n\n\nA Synchrony customer told the paper that his funds had been frozen because – he was able to wring the reason from the bank – of an out-of-state attempt to log into his account. He made the attempt; he was traveling.\n\n\nRecall Alice, the hypothetical CBDC user I invented to illustrate the horror of being locked out of using one's national currency. Her money became unavailable one day, and she had no means of finding out why or reversing the decision. This sort of thing happens today, and appears to be happening more often.\n\n\nLawyers write expansive, moralizing terms of service that allow for the removal of any even remotely risky customer. Programmers and – to the extent AI is involved in the process, programs – translate these rules into automated systems that comb customer data for unexpected activity. Law enforcement, as I mentioned above, is only remotely interested in perhaps 4% of these alerts, but there's no question of letting the justice system sort out who's guilty of wrongdoing. Anyone the banks remotely suspect of anything, they simply kick out. Why take the risk?\n\nThere's no reason to expect CBDCs to operate differently. Who will build the compliance and risk management systems, after all, if not the people who built them for the banks? The only difference will be that when the central bank debanks people, they'll have no legal way to buy or sell anything.\nThe misinformation hunt\nA trend that, for the time being, is mostly unrelated to the financial sector provides a compelling reason to worry about the freedom to transact.\n\n\nThe past decade has seen the emergence of concerted activist efforts aimed at technology companies, originating from within their ranks as well as outside – from NGOs, universities, and the government. The details of the agenda – which is far from unified – change frequently, and often on a dime, but 'progressive' is the label activists generally use, and anyone passingly familiar with the political discourse knows more or less what that term indicates in a given moment.\n\n\nProgressive campaigns have focused most heavily on social media companies, where the goal is to ";
        book.write(chapter4);
        string memory chapter5 = unicode"'deplatform' – that is, censor – unacceptable speech. Such speech includes racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry, with the crucial caveat that such labels are applied with shocking liberality: statements that would have occasioned no remark in the most progressive circles five or ten years ago frequently meet with shrieking denunciations today. Even inaction, declining to join in the denunciations or to express full-throated support for any number of mercurial shibboleths raises hackles. Silence, a common slogan has it, is violence.\n\nAnd if silence is violence, so of course is speech. And if dissent of either sort – spoken or tacit – is violence, it must be stopped by any means necessary, including real, physical violence. Once this line of thinking is pursued to its logical extreme, the usual brakes on censorship are easily dismissed as irrelevant, absurd – even, through a neat trick whereby the people stripping civil rights from their political enemies become the victims, fascist.\n\n\nPractically all of the speech the deplatformers would silence enjoys First Amendment protection. They bat away that objection. Much of the speech is factually accurate, and the deplatformers know that. No matter. If it doesn't conform to their ideological requirements, it is violence, or if that label doesn't fit, misinformation (also, disinformation).[52]\n\n\nIt has proven not just possible, but trivial, to censor disfavored voices with little to no justification beyond the invocation of that single word – misinformation – despite all the constitutional protections we might reasonably expect to stand in the way.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this expedient has proven popular not just with activists, but politicians, bureaucrats and law enforcement.\n\n\nThe Twitter Files, published in 2023 by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, have revealed that those engaged in the fight against bad speech often acknowledge privately that the posts they are censoring are factual (misinformation that's accurate has been given a special designation by censorship practitioners: malinformation).[53] They justify their inventions based on the risk that the facts could 'exacerbate distrust' in people and institutions they wish to defend.[54]\n\n\nPerhaps more important is who these misinformation fighters are. A few years ago, it was reasonable to assume that social media censorship was carried out by employees of the platforms due to pressure from, or sympathy with, activists.\n\n\nThe Twitter Files have exposed that assumption as hopelessly naïve. They have demonstrated active collaboration between employees of every major social media platform;[55] universities including Stanford and NYU; the National Conference on Citizenship, a federally chartered non-profit; and the Centers for Disease Control. Among the sources of funding for the partners involved in one such program – called the Virality Project, its focus was removing disfavored speech related to covid – are the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation.\n\n\nParticipants in this effort called for (and obtained) the creation of a 'Disinformation Governance Board' within the Department of Homeland Security. Calling this body a 'Ministry of Truth' or some other Orwellian label doesn't really enhance the impact: its real name is already apex-Orwellian.[56]\nOther revelations in the Twitter Files detail cooperation between Twitter employees and the FBI, as well as the White House. The company repeatedly acceded to requests from these entities to censor legal speech, including speech related to the 2020 presidential election.[57]\n\n\nAnother source of insight into government censorship of social media is Missouri v. Biden, a lawsuit brought by that state's attorney general, together with other plaintiffs, against the Biden administration. The discovery process in that suit has unearthed extensive evidence of First Amendment violations by the federal bureaucracy, much of it overlapping with the content of the Twitter files.[58]\n\n\nA few details add color to the overall picture: the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acted as a 'switchboard' for the censorship efforts of several executive departments, facilitating meetings that included 'DHS, FBI, U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Microsoft, and Verizon Media.'\n\nThe head of CISA, justifying the agency's role in coordinating censorship, argued that its mandate to protect infrastructure includes 'cognitive infrastructure' – that is, speech – and that 'it's really, really dangerous if people get to pick their own facts.' (The government, presumably, should be the sole arbiter of what is true.)\nThe plaintiffs note that the Census Bureau and the Treasury Department were also involved in flagging so-called misinformation to remove from social media sites. The Treasury's efforts, according to DHS documents, focused on 'public confidence' in the financial system. (I'm willing to bet that the contents of this essay constitute misinformation according to the standards of the Treasury's inquisitors.)\n\nThe Virality Project, mentioned above, 'provided strategic insights to government entities such as the OSG [Office of the Surgeon General], CDC, and the Department of Health and Human Services,' according to the complaint. The OSG in particular pressured Facebook and other social media companies to remove content related to covid.\n\n\nThe suit also details the government's coordination with platforms to remove election-related posts. Much of this was conducted through the Election Integrity Partnership, a Stanford-affiliated 'non-partisan coalition' that makes no mention, at least publicly, of having been set up by CISA.  (According to the complaint, this is 'simply another moniker' for the Virality Project; both refer to the same teams engaged in the same activities.)\n\n\nTo be clear: the executive branch, overseen by the president, created an organization to censor content related to presidential elections.\n\n\nElections being the main constitutional means of replacing the president and preventing him or her from staying on for life, I'd argue that people holding that office shouldn't be allowed to dictate what can and can't be said about elections. The fact that the effort was presented as purely academic and unaffiliated with the government is all the more galling.\n\n\nWhat could justify such antidemocratic behavior on the part of the government? They were putting a stop to violence of course. Except this violence, like so much of the 'violence' people are accused of these days, was simply to speech – or more precisely, hesitance to curtail others' speech. In July 2021, Biden publicly accused platforms of 'killing people' by allowing users to post alleged misinformation related to covid. Shortly thereafter the White House threatened to revisit legislation exempting platforms from legal liability for information users post there. Social media companies responded with a flurry of activity, reviewing or taking down posts and accounts the government had (privately) expressed distaste for.\n\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit also note that the government has moved beyond policing election- and covid-related posts, branching into 'climate change, 'gendered disinformation,' abortion and economic policy' as well as 'racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.'\n\n\nNo single thread runs through all of these topics, except current-year partisan politics, meaning in essence that the White House feels at liberty to order the removal of any content from any social media platform, so long as it disagrees with the political stance of the content.\n\n\nWe're presented with further evidence that misinformation – as a non-expert might describe it – is not the real concern. Facebook's parent company Meta (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) reassured the White House that it will target 'non-violative content, such as discussing the choice to vaccinate in terms of personal or civil liberties.' The factuality – forget the constitutionally protected status – of the content is not considered important; rather the acceptable line has been laid down (vaccines are safe and effective) and any challenge to that line, even if grounded in reality, must be removed.\n\n\nAnd just to emphasize something that's easy to miss in the foregoing: discussions of civil liberties were explicitly singled out for removal, itself a violation of civil liberties.\n\n\nA coordinated censorship campaign embracing social media companies, numerous government agencies, universities, law enforcement bodies, NGOs, the military, the White House, and miscellaneous activists already exists. Its participants are pleased with their success so far in curtailing constitutionally protected expression and plan to expand their efforts to any topic they deem politically salient, not stopping at elections themselves.\n\n\nIt would be appealing and no doubt rather simple for the censors to expand along another axis, from social media platforms into payment systems. As Taibbi noted in a statement delivered to Congress, 'ordinary Americans are not just being reported to Twitter for 'deamplification' or de-platforming, but to firms like PayPal [...] and crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.'[59]\n\n\nThe financial services sector is joining the misinformation crusade.\nJPMorgan Chase\nIgnoring Canada, banks don't yet condition their services on customers' holding acceptable views, at least to my knowledge.[60] There appears to have been a high-profile exception to the rule, however, and it could be a sign of things to come.\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase closed Kanye 'Ye' West's accounts after the artist made a string of explicitly antisemitic comments in the fall of 2022.[61] West's rhetoric – including a threat to go 'death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE' – escalated in the weeks following his bank's decision to cut ties, and before long he was publicly indulging in unambiguous praise for Hitler.\n\n\nIf there were ever speech that merited ejection from the financial system, I suppose this would be it. It is cartoonishly villainous to glorify one of history's greatest mass murderers and menace one of the communities he singled out for physical extermination. But accepting such a premise – that access to banking is subject to an ideological test of any sort – is fundamentally illiberal, and down the line it poses a greater threat to freedom and justice than some obviously unwell celebrity's embrace of Nazism.\n\n\nNow JPMorgan Chase, to my knowledge, is at perfect liberty, legally speaking, to end its relationship with Ye for this or any number of reasons. (Nor, to my knowledge, is there any proof that Ye's comments were the reason for the bank's decision.)\n\n\nBut as with PayPal, such decisions set a precedent that withholding the ability to transact is an effective and convenient means of social control. It's difficult to argue that the people running a private business – bank executives, say – should be compelled to provide services to someone they don't want as a customer. They should enjoy their own freedoms, after all.\n\n\nBut in the realm of finance and payments, the line between the state and private business breaks down before it's even drawn. Personnel move freely between Wall Street C-suites and the Treasury, along with any number of ministries of finance and financial regulatory bodies around the world. Just 15 years ago, American taxpayers bailed out the world's largest banks. A century before that, the country's richest bankers bailed out the American government.\n\n\nIt's far from surprising that when Canada ordered banks to summarily freeze the accounts of anti-lockdown protesters, the banks complied without a (public) word of complaint.\n\n\nNor is it surprising that PayPal acts as freelance private-sector law enforcement, doing its best to crack down on activities without asking the government to trouble itself with obtaining warrants or even making specific requests. Often enough, the activities aren't illegal, so law enforcement would have little hope of following the constitutionally prescribed procedure.\n\n\nReturning to Ye, though: should we shed a tear for the man in a ski mask extolling Hitler's contributions to civilization?[62] I don't plan to, but nor should we let contempt for this specific individual cloud our vision of the principles at stake. If only people who sank to such a level were targeted for financial exclusion, I doubt much practical damage would result. The world might even marginally improve.\n\n\nBut authoritarian overreach often targets the least sympathetic figures first, then, once it's gained momentum, moves towards the center. The 18th-century French revolutionaries began by defining an aristocrat as French society always had: a titular member of the nobility, recognized as such by clergy, commoners and other aristocrats alike. Many of the revolutionaries being aristocrats themselves, they weren't generally bent on killing the whole caste.\n\n\nWithin a few years, however, an 'aristocrat' could be anyone, commoner, noble or priest, unfortunate enough to fall foul of the mob. The virtuous revolutionary 'citizen' denouncing this aristocrat could be a member of the nobility who had renounced their title.[63] 'Aristocrat' was simply shorthand for a counterrevolutionary, a heretic. To be labeled one was to be one – no daylight shone between accusation and conviction – and to be one was to deserve death.\n\n\nWe might consider the case of Ye's interviewer in the ski mask incident, who practically pleaded with the artist to express at least some reservation regarding the Third Reich. Alex Jones is not generally known as a voice of reason. He is notorious for a years-long campaign meant to discredit and torment – of all people – the parents of victims of an elementary school shooting. \n\n\nUnsurprisingly then, when Jones was removed from all major internet platforms in 2018,[64] words of protest were few and far between. Who could regard the slippery slope of censorship with such dread that they'd defend the Sandy Hook truther?\n\n\nBut there were those who warned that the same fate would befall more and more people, for less and less heinous speech, and they were correct.[65] Today people are routinely removed from social platforms for posting 'misinformation.' As noted above, in many if not most cases, this speech is a matter of opinion, and in a sizable minority of cases, the 'misinformation' is factually correct, but considered somehow unseemly.\n\n\nDebates over the effectiveness of covid vaccines brought many such cases to light. As Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023:\n\n\n'take some of the stuff around covid earlier on in the pandemic, where there were real health implications, but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions, and unfortunately I think a lot of the kind of establishment on that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true.'[66]\n\n\nIt's not necessary, however, to make analogies to social media platforms to argue that financial deplatforming will hit a slippery slope. PayPal started sloping long ago, moving from policing sex work to policing speech.\nGuns, porn and abortion\nThe reasons behind PayPal or JPMorgan's actions can be guessed at, but the conversations that precipitated them are opaque and will probably stay that way. In some cases, though, financial deplatforming – or steps in that direction – are clearly the result of long and targeted activist campaigns.\n\n\nIn September 2022, Visa, Amex and Mastercard agreed to categorize gun sales differently from other 'general merchandise' purchases, the category under which such sales previously fell.\n\n\nThis added surveillance allows credit card companies to 'flag suspicious purchases or more easily trace how guns and ammunition are sold,' according to the Associated Press, which described the development as a 'significant win' for gun control advocates.[67]\n\n\nTo state the obvious, these activists aren't elected, so they can't be removed from office by voters. They aren't businesses, so they can't be pushed to change course by customers (though customers can and should punish the businesses that cave to such activists' demands).\nThese groups aren't directly accountable to ordinary people who need to make and receive payments, yet they're able to constrain these people's freedom to transact. They do so in order to make it more difficult to engage in legal activities that, in the activists' opinion, shouldn't be legal. Rather than accept the outcome of the democratic process and continue campaigning for stricter gun control, such groups enforce their preferred version of the law by lobbying for changes to the internal processes of financial platforms: legislation by other means.\n\n\nGiven the success of this technique, it's a matter of time before pressure groups subject a wider range of legal purchases to added scrutiny, without the hassle of winning elections and passing laws.\n\n\nThe editor of a Catholic news outlet spoke to Visa CEO Alfred Kelly in 2023, pressing him to consider whether the company was 'funding' the sexual exploitation of minors by processing users' payments to PornHub.[68]\n\n\nPro-choice activists have expressed justifiable concerns that opponents of abortion, another politically charged issue, are likely to seek out payments data in order to punish women who obtain the procedure. In 2022, after decades of campaigning on the issue and pushing for the nomination of Supreme Court justices who would overturn a 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide, pro-life activists managed to ban it outright in several U.S. states.[69]\n\n\nWomen in these places are able to travel to other states to have the procedure (though in practice this isn't always feasible), and some advocates of the ban wish to prosecute those who do so. Payments data is a convenient way to gather evidence for such prosecutions.\n\n\nContacted by the New York Times, few payments providers would say what they would do in response to subpoenas from, say, Texas authorities seeking information on a woman's financial activity. Experts interviewed by the paper pointed out that courts could potentially order companies to turn the data over, as well as issuing gag orders to prevent them from alerting the woman alleged to have sought the abortion. She in turn could face jail time.[70]\n\n\nExplaining the precedents for such subpoenas, the Times wrote, 'Card issuers have grown used to requests for user data in terrorism, money-laundering and illegal-trafficking investigations.' The slope slippens.\nThe war on cash\nOf course, the authorities' and activists' ability to exploit payment rails as a chokepoint goes out the window if people simply pay cash. Unsurprisingly, then, the state is making efforts to curtail its use. It's common to hear politicians and policy wonks disparage the evils of 'dirty' paper money: dirty both in the literal sense, of germ-carrying bills, and more importantly in the figurative sense, of filthy lucre obtained illicitly.\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetization of large rupee notes in 2016 had the stated aim of flushing 'black money' out of the economy and moving towards a 'cashless society.'[71] The move caused immense disruption, forcing millions to line up outside of banks and ATMs (over a hundred people reportedly died in these lines). What it did not do was eliminate cash or leave the beneficiaries of crime and corruption stranded: essentially all demonetized notes were exchanged, so 99.3% of the dirty money blighting the Indian economy before demonetization continued to circulate afterwards.[72]\n\n\nIt's common to envision a near future in which cash has been eliminated entirely, but that's not to say it's an edgy or futuristic vision: people simply assume at some level that cash's time is limited. What use, outside of crime, could grubby paper notes have in an otherwise digital world?\n\n\nWhile it's possible that these assumptions are the natural product of the internet and smartphones, we can't be sure, because we can't ignore the effect of decades of legislation aimed at limiting the use of cash to small, everyday transactions.\n\n\nIn a piece published by Coin Center, University of Virginia Law School adjunct professor Abraham Sutherland details the history, effects and intention of the law's most powerful disincentive against the use of cash: section 6050I of the U.S. tax code, passed in 1984.[73]\n\n\nToday, Sutherland writes, due to this provision and its subsequent expansions and revisions, 'if you use large amounts of physical currency, there's something wrong with you, and it's probably that you're a criminal. It's such a legally fraught hassle that there's no other explanation.'\n\n\nIn 1970, in an effort to combat or be seen to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, banks were required to report cash transactions over $10,000, the equivalent of $65,000 today. In 1984, anyone performing commercial transactions was required to report similarly sized transactions by the passage of section 6050I. This allowed law enforcement to go after drug dealers for failure to report cash income, particularly after 1988, when violations were upgraded to felonies. (According to Sutherland, this is the only information reporting requirement carrying felony penalties.)\n\n\nThis change to tax law massively enhanced the state's capacity for financial surveillance. Whatever its intended purpose, this has become the law's most consequential effect, and the state has strengthened the statute in order to enhance this capacity further.\n\n\nThe reporting requirement has become a window, easily available to law enforcement of any description, into the financial lives of Americans. Any cash transaction of more-than-quotidian importance now must be shared with the tax authorities, who of course are normally barred from violating taxpayers' confidentiality. But the exception to this rule, passed by Congress in 1988, is Form 8300, the form the IRS requires anyone receiving $10,000 or more to file.\n\n\nThe Treasury can share your Form 8300 with employees of any federal agency or, as of 1996, any agency of any state or local – even foreign – government. Nor do these lax controls actually limit how widely cash transaction data can be shared: in 2001, Congress copy-pasted the text of 6050I into the Bank Secrecy Act, requiring the same information be shared with FinCEN, who can then treat it with even less regard for privacy than the IRS does.\n\n\nCash transaction reporting requirements militate against the logic of normal commerce. To accept, say, $20,000 in cash in exchange for some good or service requires a seller to verify their counterparty's government ID, obtain their Social Security number and date of birth, record their occupation, and describe the transaction. The seller then signs the form under penalty of perjury and mails it to the IRS in at most 15 days. Failure to meet this high bar of peer-to-peer surveillance on behalf of the government can result in a $25,000 fine or five years in prison.\n\n\nSutherland depicts what navigating it routinely might be like for a law-abiding business owner who wants to deal in cash. I suggest reading it; it's maddening. His point, though, is that such business owners are hypothetical. They do not and cannot exist, because at some point, they must give up on either cash or compliance. So cash is in practice an illegal medium of payment for businesses, unless they limit themselves to accepting it from customers in small amounts – the way a restaurant might – and immediately depositing it to a bank account.\n\n\nThis burdensome process encourages anyone not dealing in organs harvested from the living to simply use banks. But the process reveals something about the role of banks, at least from the government's perspective: the high-fidelity surveillance that merchants are required to perform on their counterparties is simply the level of surveillance the state can expect its compliant financial sect";
